"Shannon Devery with Digital Financial Group has been an ASCCA partner for over ten years, and many of us consider her a close friend. Shannon has had a challenging year, to say the least. Her house was damaged when a monsoon hit during a re-roofing project. Her Mom passed away. More recently, she has received a cancer diagnosis and will undergo a complicated surgery on 9/28/2022.

Shannon needs our support! Her medical bills are already mounting, and her battle is just beginning. In addition to the medical expenses, she pays out of pocket for necessary expensive holistic therapy as part of her overall treatment plan.

Please donate to help ease this burden and allow her to focus on her recovery.",sadness
"Hi my name is Charles! Iâm fundraising to help save, our beagle, Nalaâs life. She is currently in need of a IVDD related back surgery. If not unfortunately we will be forced to humanely euthanize her. The kids will be crushed but itâs just a surgery we can not afford. We love her so much and have spent so much money on her diagnosis and many treatments that we are completely tapped on funds. Anything will help but we ultimately have a range of $5,000-$7,500 for the complete surgery. I absolutely hate that it has come to this but Iâm hoping for the best from anyone with a kind heart. We have applied for multiple financial add options and have not yet received any assistance. Thank you for reading and most importantly your donations.",anger
"Mom has Dementia. She is only 68 years old with no significant health problems otherwise. It happened abruptly. The small early signs were unnoticed by most people. Last month everything changed. Mom was no longer able to take care of things. She started to get lost while driving. Over the next few weeks, significant changes were happening quickly. We have been in and out of the Doctors offices and hospitals weekly. At this point mom is no longer able to stay at her home alone. The funds need to stay at an assisted living facility are $5000 a month. She had to go into one because we didnât have everything in place to bring her home. Itâs a really big surprise to everyone. Mom had to be discharged from the hospital into a safe environment. Mom had became a flight risk. We need some assistance to keep mom safe and in a protected environment. We still have a long way to go. Thank you for giving.",surprise
"Hey yâall!! Iâm Bailey! Iâm putting this up to help my second mom fight her breast cancer. She is a single mom of a 12 year old boy who loves to play football. Jessica is one of the hardest workers Iâve ever met. Sheâs the most caring and loving human being. Breast cancer is not in her family so when she was diagnosed it was a total surprise. Her next surgery will put her out of work for 8 weeks. This is to help her keep a roof over her and her sons head and keep them fed and healthy. And of course bills but those are no fun to talk about. Anyways, anything helps! Thank you for reading and sharing her story! We are so grateful for you allâ¤ï¸",surprise
"My name is Derek Jambon. I am making this account for my girlfriend Ashley Willie.
 
Ashley is a student in the Occupational Therapy Assistant Program at Delgado Community Colllege, and in early August Ashley was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer weeks before school began. This is where her long road ahead began.  She has been doing well along her journey. Her determination continues to surprise me and makes me proud that she is continuing school while having her Chemo treatments.

While we do not want to ask for help, insurance covers portions of her treatments but a lot is still left for Ashley to pay.  She is facing surgery, radiation and an additional Surgery in the coming months.   Without income itâs making it difficult to cover those expenses along with insurance and normal monthly expenses. Any money donations raised will be strictly used for medical expenses. Helping us at this time would mean the world to our families and us. We are so thankful for everything everyone has done for us so far.   We appreciate anyway you can help us, being donations or prayers.",surprise
"Hi Iâm haylee and in the picture is a ten month old black lab who is perfect for my best friend annika she suffers from dysautonomia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and what we think is functional neurological disorder, which causes things like seizures and Mobility problems. Annika has found the perfect dog to be her service dog in training after months of searching. This dog would be life changing, Annika lives alone so the risk of her having a seizure and hurting herself is massive, and scares the people that care about her everyday. This dog would give her freedom and independence that she has been lacking in recent months because of her conditions. Annika is an absolute light in the world she works in a school helping kids everyday, and she is always there when her loved ones need her so please help us get her this life changing medical equipment. So that her light may continue to shine! The dog is $3,500 so the rest of the $500 that make up the $4,000 would go directly to things like gear, food, a kennel, and toys to welcome him home!",fear

"On January 22nd, our family learned that our sweet 3 year old niece, Evelyn,  has been diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic High Risk Neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer that develops in a part of the peripheral nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system. After not feeling well , she was admitted to the hospital for fluids to treat what we thought to be a typical stomach virus. We then received the devastating news that these mild symptoms were actually the result of this rare pediatric cancer.  She went from feeling healthy, happy and playing outside to gearing up for her first round of chemotherapy within 2 weeks.  This news has come as a total shock for everyone and has completely turned our worlds upside down, especially for her parents, Coco and TJ. Evelyn has now been transferred to UF Health Shands in Gainesville, FL and has begun her first of many rounds of chemotherapy, followed by numerous other treatments. This will be a long road for Evelyn and her parents, so any amount that you can give to help relieve the burden of financial worries would be greatly appreciated, as no one should have to worry about money during a time like this. All donations will go directly to Coco and TJ to help offset the costs of medical bills, travel, relocating, and any other costs associated with her treatment. Please keep Evelyn, Coco and TJ in your thoughts and prayers during this time.",surprise
"Hello everyone. I am raising funds to assist in my battle against Multiple Myeloma cancer.

I was diagnosed with cancer in June of 2022. At the time of this diagnosis I was living in Anguilla. I had recently quit my full-time job to start a handmade bagmaking business. The news of this diagnosis was shocking and devastating to both my family and I having just dealt with the recent passing of our mom.

I have relied heavily on the support (financial and emotional) of my immediate and extended family. I am forever grateful and indebted to everyone who supported and continue to support me.

My life as I knew it prior to my June diagnosis has dramatically changed. My start-up business had to be put on hold.  I also had to temporarily move to the United States for cancer treatment.  My frequent treatments, living in a new country and follow-up visits to doctors does not allow me to work.

It would mean the world to me for any financial contribution you can provide. Your generosity will assist in covering medical expenses directly related to my treatment and recovery. This will give me the opportunity to focus my energy on fighting and beating this cancer.

Thanks.",surprise
"Hello, my name is Andy, Samantha's husband. A couple of weeks ago, after a late-night trip to Enloe Hospital due to multiple seizures, Samantha was diagnosed with a large glioma, a tumor located in the left side of her brain. We were immediately referred to U.C. San Francisco. The doctor decided that surgery sooner than later was necessary. Last week we went for more testing and pre-op work, and on Tuesday, the doctor performed a 6-hour surgery to remove the tumor. She is now resting comfortably at home, and will soon start physical therapy. Please keep Samantha in your thoughts and prayers during the recovery process.
We are hoping for some help with our very large unexpected medical bills and travel expenses during our UC San Francisco visit.",optimism

"Join me, Ryan Solis, in helping raise money for Valerie Rodriguez, a wife and mom of 3 beautiful children, who is fighting stage 4 ovarian cancer. Valerie was diagnosed in April 2022. What's crazy is that her husband Abel had just been declared cancer free in December 2021 after his own grueling battle with stage 4 cancer. Their children were overjoyed when Daddy received the good news and equally devastated when Mommy received her diagnosis. But the Rodriguez family is resilient and has already beat cancer once and is ready to beat it again.

Fighting cancer requires many resources, and with an upcoming surgery, Valerie and her family need help with medical bills and living expenses. Valerie had to quit her job once she was diagnosed, which created a financial strain on the family. The strain is not only brought about by costly hospital stays and medical procedures. I was shocked to learn how expensive all the miscellaneous items are that she purchases to alleviate the suffering she endures post-chemo.

Let's help Valerie and her family. No amount is too small. Anything that can be spared will be much appreciated and will help alleviate the financial strain on the family. Fighting stage 4 cancer is hard enough; having to fight cancer while also worrying about paying bills makes the fight even more challenging. I ask that you contribute anything you can to help Valerie and her family through this tough time.",surprise
"Losing a child is never easy but losing a child you didnât even know you were carrying has to be in a whole different ballpark. My best friend, Lyn, carried her sweet baby boy to term, not knowing she was pregnant.

The week of November 14th, Lyn was sick, throwing up for days, and was unable to go to work. She thought she was sick with the flu. On November 17th, she started having (what she thought was) muscle spasms in her back but she was unknowingly experiencing back labor. Around 6:30 that evening, Alexander Dale would make his shocking entrance into the world. Lyn gave birth to him standing up in her bedroom and he wasnât breathing. Luckily, her mother was home visiting and was able to call 911 and perform CPR on Alexander but, sadly, he was already gone.

Please consider donating to help Lyn & DJ through this tough time, as they mourn the loss of their sweet baby boy. This will help Lyn financially while she recovers and until she is cleared to go back to work, and to also help with hospital bills, etc.",sadness

"  Hi all,
I wanted to do an update on this page.
First, Keith is still recovering and has good days and bad days, but his recovery timeline is still what the doctor's said it would be, so he is progressing, it will just take time to get back to 100%.
He is now wanting to start working part time and so needs his car, which as many of you know is not exactly reliable. He needs a new radiator, alternator, starter brakes, tires and some electrical and they are looking at around $4k - $5k to get it ready and safe to drive again. It won't even start right now, so we had to tow it to the shop. UGGGGG!!!
He can't get financing for another car without a job and can't get a job without a car, so he is stuck right now until we get his car fixed and he is feeling pretty depressed about how he can get his life back with no car and no job, so I thought since everyone was so incredibley helpful with his medical recovery bills and expenses, I would ask again for help. I hate asking again, but can't think of another option right now.
Every single dollar helps and if you can share this with anyone that knows him, it would be great!

"Hi to All- I am writing this story on behalf of my best friend, Brandy, and her son, Elijah.  Many of you know that Elijah was diagnosed very recently with AML, a very aggressive form of leukemia.  He has finished his first 10 days of intensive chemotherapy treatments, and now we all wait for upcoming blood test results over the next few weeks, to see where he stands in this fight.  

Elijah is an amazing 14 year old!  Kind, soft spoken, a double black belt in Tae Kwon Do, a saxophone player, precious soul with animals and all of his humans.  Loves a good laugh, legos, his video games, and loves the beach!

His momma is taking time off work, unpaid, to be by his bedside.  As we all can imagine, this is hard enough without the worry about how any extra or surprise medical bills get paid, how regular bills get paid, how a small Starbucks treat gets obtained, which Elijah loves!  If you find it in your heart to bless them with anything, now is the time, and no amount will go unnoticed or without gracious thanks.  

We are ELIJAH STRONG!

He is in the fight of his life, letâs make the burden a little easier for them, if you are able.  ",love

"My name is Rosalie York, and I'm raising funds for my Sister, Gelsey, her partner Matt, and her sweet family. My sister was a hit-and-run victim in December of 2021. She sustained injuries that have changed her and her family's lives. She has been unable to work since and will not be able to work again for the foreseeable future. Gelsey has started the long process of applying for disability, but there's no way of knowing how long it will take. Her partner, Matt, has also been experiencing health issues that make working extremely difficult and painful. They've had to rely on their savings to cover medical needs, mortgage payments and bills up to this point. Without assistance, they'll soon be at risk of losing their home.

"Hello all,


Late last year, our Anne discovered she had breast cancer during one of her routine screening checkups.

She has a great medical team behind her, and plans to take this head on and have them perform a double mastectomy with reconstruction, which will hopefully prevent future recurrences.

As we all know, medical costs are a lot to deal with, even with insurance. Iâm starting this fund with the hopes that Anne will not have to bear the burden alone. Donate what you can, or send Anne a message to let her know you are there for her. Sheâs an amazing person and I know she has been there for us all at some point. We love you Anne!",love
"Hi, My name is Richard. I live and work in Nevada USA. This is probably one of the hardest things for me as I'm not one to ask for help, but as the main breadwinner for a household of seven, I must swallow my pride and ask for any help possible. In June of this year, I suffered a Heart attack, all went very well, and I recovered well. I firmly believe that the heart attack was for a reason because with all the follow-up tests and scans, we found out that I have prostate cancer, and I don't think we would have found out so early, now with the bills, time lost from work from the heart attack, now I have to contend with treatment, travel, lost time and basic costs with my battle with a cancer diagnosis. I know I will beat this, and at the end of the day, bills will be paid. My biggest fear eventually with all of this is the impact it will have on my family. currently, our household consists of myself, my wife of 32 wonderful years, my mother, my daughter, my son-in-law, and 2 grandchildren. If you can help, I would be so thankful; if you can't, I am still grateful that you took the time to read about my journey. Humbly yours R.L.Hawley",fear

"Last year my mom was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer and it was extremely difficult for our family. When I heard the C word I thought I was losing my mom, but her team of doctors reassured us that it would be okay. It was still hard to watch my mom go through chemo and radiation and see her in pain day in and day out. She completed chemotherapy, but did not get better. Her symptoms got worse and she became bedridden and depressed. Last week we took her to the ER only to find out that there are new complications with her colon and the area in which she had radiation. The doctors are not hopeful and said this isn't looking too good for her. I'm so afraid of losing my mom, my rock, and my bestfriend. The house is quiet and my dad and I are trying to manage, but it's becoming more and more difficult each day. Please keep my mom in your prayers and even 1 donation would be greatly appreciated and will go towards her medical bills and surgery. Thank you if you've read this far.

"Friends & Family,

Your thoughts, prayers, and positivity are with Joey as he navigates treatment and care for his recent diagnosis of T Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukemia (ALL).

Joey had a bad cough and was seen at Urgent Care on 11/5. They said it was pneumonia and directed him to the ER at St. Joseph Mercy in Pontiac. Further testing discovered an 8x5 inch mass in his chest with fluid around his lungs and heart. Emergency surgery was performed on 11/7 to relieve the pressure on his heart.
After lots of imaging and biopsies, he was diagnosed with cancer on 11/10.

On 11/11, Joey was transferred to UofM for treatment. He will be there for his entire first round of intensive chemotherapy with Megan by his side.

Any help is appreciated so they can focus on his battle without the added financial stress of mounting medical bills, housing costs, and meals.

If you cannot donate monetarily, we ask that you help us lift them with thoughts, prayers, and love. Letâs remind Joey that he is not alone!

Another way to help is to donate blood at REDCROSSBLOOD.ORG and see if you are a potential bone marrow match with BETHEMATCH.ORG

May God Bless the medical staff at St. Joseph Mercy and UofM Hospitals for all they have done and continue to do for him and all others with this horrible disease.

Chance has spent the better part of his adult life serving this community, as a volunteer fireman, supporting local fundraising, and having good old fashion friendships with so many in our community. Earlier this month Chance was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer. This news shocked us all. The doctors said that Chance is young and has high expectations of beating this! With that being said it is still going to be a long journey. Chance has already started his chemo treatments before starting radiation and then surgery. All of these cost immensely.

"This fundraiser is to help offset some expenses for my daughter and son in law while they are both away from work while they are in Iowa City trying to help keep their baby girls remain in utero for as long as possible.

At 21 weeks and 5 days, their baby B was diagnosed with a diaphragmatic hernia by maternal fetal medicine after a concern arose on their 20 week scan. While at that appointment, they also learned that her cervix was thin and dilated. A bag of her amniotic fluid was bulging. She was immediately moved to UIHC where they are doing everything to keep her babies growing inside for as long as possible. Sheâs made it to 22 weeks today and hopefully there are many more days of waiting before she delivers.

They have great health insurance so please know that this fundraiser is for time away from work, travel, and other expenses. None of us like to ask for help but their village of support is asking what they can do. First and foremost, they ask for prayers, positive thoughts, and good vibes. If anyone would like to contribute financially, that would be wonderful. If not,
please keep all the good juju coming their way because that matters more than anything else right now.",optimism
"I'm John Hogan and I'm living with end-stage renal disease. My current life is constrained by thrice-weekly 4+ hour visits to dialysis, with the ultimate premature ending of my life always in sight. Additional risks of living with non-working kidneys are blindness and limb loss. (Our bodies really aren't designed to live without entire organs, no matter how great the technology for dialysis is!) However, a living donor can change all of this, enabling full days, travel, improved health, and more time to dedicate to my community, as I am wont to do.

To my profound joy, my son has volunteered (unasked) to be a living donor and is a perfect match. His medical costs are covered by the living donor program, but he will need to take time off work for the surgery and his recovery. Since he is self-employed and a full-time father of five, this is a very real need. I'm committed to having these costs covered for him before I will accept this life-saving gift.

Please support my son in his selfless act of giving me back my life by pitching in on his living expenses for himself and his family for several weeks.",joy

"This past year has really shown me that life can be unpredictable and there are no guarantees, regardless of how young or healthy you are.
Back in April 2021, I was diagnosed with a brain tumor; a grade 2 glioma, and had a craniotomy in August to resect as much of the tumor as possible.
The discussion of a shortened lifespan brought on several panicked thoughts about what I might not be able to experience.
One of those thoughts was of not being able to have children of my own.
I felt completely overwhelmed thinking I may have to rush into starting a family.
But after researching fertility preservation, everything felt a little more tolerable.
My eggs need to be harvested before any potential cancer treatment is needed and because apparently 34 is old in âegg age.â
Unfortunately, fertility clinics arenât set up for people who want children but donât have a ton of moneyâ¦so this fundraising attempt is my last option.
I realize $50k is a lofty goal at bestâ¦BUT, if it works out, itâll allow me to harvest my eggs AND have enough to fund a few cycles of IVF!
Any amount will make a huge difference in making this dream a reality â¤ï¸

We are truly lucky to call her our friend. If you know Lauren, we know you feel the same. Thatâs why we ask for help as medical bills pile up. Help Lauren receive her cancer preventive surgery so she can be her happiest & healthiest self. We love you, Syd!!!

In October, Lauren went to a dermatologist for a suspicious mole on her umbilical (belly button). It was biopsied, and The pathology report came back stating that the mole and the surrounding area has pre-cancerous cells.

Since the belly button is attached to the intestines, Lauren was sent to a general surgeon who will excise the surrounding area and down into the umbilical (big words for saying she will undergo a surgery to remove the pre cancerous cells from her belly button to prevent cancer from forming in her umbilical).

Along with her umbilical, her lymph-nodes are enlarged, with a nodule on one. Lauren has been having imaging and biopsies done on the area to ensure that the nodules are benign.

All of the past and upcoming Doctor appointments have caused her to miss a decent amount of work, precious time with her son and of course, the medical bills are racking up, even with insurance.",love

Well, Howie now needs our help and positivity. Howie had a hemorrhagic stroke on November 17th and is currently in the ICU.

The journey will be a marathon, not a sprint. While this is happening, Howie will not be able to work and his wife Emily, his children, Madi, Andrew, and McKay will have so much to focus on, outside of financial concerns, and this is where we can help.

Many hands make light work. Let us come together to assist this wonderful and involved family. Any amount of contribution will help. Howieâs road to recovery will be arduous and prolonged.

"Hi, my name is Amber, I am fundraising to help cover the cost of expenses incurred for medical bills, travel expenses and end-of-life care for my grandfather David Smith.

Over the last year, his health has been rapidly declining as he has been battling various health issues including dementia. In December he became bedridden and on the first of January he was flown to Colorado Springs for surgery and then moved into hospice. In the early morning hours of January 15, he passed peacefully in his sleep. My father who has been his primary caregiver over the last several years has been unable to work due to his own health issues and the harsh reality that loved ones with dementia require constant attention and help.

We know that times are difficult for everyone right now so asking for help is a very hard thing for us to do.

"Hello my friends. We received a devastating blow this week in the form of a very aggressive cancer diagnosis for my Momma. What we were hoping was a timeframe of years has been whittled down to weeks. As I live on the opposite side of the country, getting back to the Pacific Northwest to be with family for her end-of-life times is quite an undertaking. My partner and I are still very much a paycheck-to-paycheck household and there's a good chance I'll be away from work for a couple of months.

What we spent two years chasing down as what we thought was some sort of sciatic nerve back pain, ended up being stage 3 colorectal cancer. A week later we found out it had spread to both lungs. I am not a smoker nor ever have been. We were surprised to say the least. I have already endured radiation treatment and have recently started chemo by IV port and by pills. As you can imagine this has been the most difficult thing my family and I have ever gone through. My husband is a teacher and I am currently drawing short term disability, which is coming to an end. A new year means that we start paying out of pocket again and our limited budget is razor thin. We are just trying to stay afloat in what feels like an endless ocean of hardship. Our families and friends are a great support team but they can only do so much.

You can follow my story on my tik tok account @aadamson21.

"My name is Nina and I am  a 4 year old Great Pyrenees service dog. I help my human mommy for she can't walk very well so when she falls I get her up.
I became very sick but the vet doesn't know what is wrong with me. The vet said that I needed to go to a vet called a neurology specialist for very special treatments which will help me walk again.
The treatments will cost around $5250 . Please help me with my medical care expenses for I am so sick but I don't want to have to leave my mommy to go away over the Rainbow Bridge for she loves me so much and needs me even more as she grows older.
I love my mommy so please help me so I can continue to help my mommy when she cannot help herself. TY everyone.

Please share Nina's heart warming plea for medical help with your friends and family. Together we can all make a positive difference in the lives of Nina and her owner.",love
"On December 7, Aubree and her 6-month-old son, Kymani, were the victims of a tragic act of domestic violence.

Aubree survived but is facing a devastating new reality. Kymaniâs injuries were not survivable. As she grieves the loss of her son, sheâs also beginning to process her own prognosis, paraplegia - loss of leg function.

Grief on top of grief, including the complexity that the assailant was a beloved member of their family.

Some tragedies are beyond words and as much as we want to answer why, no amount of detail will satisfy the question. The family asks that the public respect their privacy as they navigate the complicated grief ahead of them.

At the same time, they are overwhelmed with gratitude at the support of first responders, neighbors, friends, and family.

Many have asked how you can help.

Along with medical and funeral expenses, almost everything in Aubreeâs life - housing, occupation (hairdresser), and vehicle will need to transition to accommodate her paralysis.

In lieu of flowers, meals and other gifts the family greatly appreciates - they instead ask that you give towards Aubreeâs future.

"Weâre reaching out to you today to ask for your generosity in helping a family during their time of loss and continuing uncertainty. Angelica Arce sadly and unexpectedly lost her life recently due to carbon monoxide poisoning. While out of town attending an event, the house where Angelica and her siblings were staying filled with carbon monoxide. Sadly Angelica lost her life. Andrea and Marco Antonio, Angelicaâs siblings, are still in the hospital in Mexico undergoing treatment as they were at the house at the same time. The Arceâs parents, Gloria, who just finished cancer treatment not to long ago,  and Marco will be staying in Mexico until their remaining two children are fully recovered. We are hoping to raise $50,000 to help ease the current financial burden which include covering memorial expenses for Angelica, ongoing medical expenses for Andrea and Marco Antonio, in addition to their lodging in Mexico City until they are able to return home with their surviving children.",sadness
"This past Sunday 3/3/19, this sweet family suffered a loss no one should ever have to endure due to the catastrophic tornado that crippled the Lee County area of Alabama. Tyesha Hart lost her oldest daughter, Mykkhayla, to the violent storm. The family has also lost their entire home and all of their belongings, as have so many other families in Lee County.  

Such a quick and sudden loss has left this family in need as Tyesha, her two younger daughters, and boyfriend are still hospitalized in Birmingham. Tyesha will very soon have to plan her daughterâs funeral, something no one plans for. 

Please, if you are able to donate any amount, please consider doing so. These funds will go directly to the family for whatever their needs are including medical expenses, hotel and food costs, and funeral expenses.

All of you will know by now that I have been battling stage 4 breast cancer and it certainly hasnât been an easy time in my life but I had a successful surgery and have been getting good results back and it appears that the Immunotherapy is working as my cancer cell count has continued to decline every week.

If you know me, you know Iâm not very good at asking for help but I really need a little help to raise the funds for the second stretch of my immunotherapy.

Any help at all would be so greatly appreciated and I hope to see each and everyone of you in the not so distant future in a much healthier and stronger state where we can enjoy a pint together and have a laugh.

Josh Rabidue has been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis; unfortunately, he has already racked up his medical bills before Christmas. Those who love and care about Josh want him to focus on becoming healthy again without the added stress of paying his medical bills. This has been a rough year, from his kitten needing costly surgery, his car going kaput, and now this.

"The fact is this: we are in the midst of a global crisis and are sending our first responders into battle without any protective equipment. We can do better! 

Day after day, like you, we hear the harrowing stories of our modern-day heroes and just couldnât sit by any longer.  We are lucky to know a reliable supplier that can ship 10,000 medical-grade N95 masks to New York-Presbyterian in the next 10 days if we can raise $27,000 in the next two days.  

Every dollar counts. Each mask costs $2.70. 

The shipment will be handled by a senior nurse at NYP and will go DIRECTLY from the factory to the hospital without any bureaucracy. Let's see how well this campaign goes, and maybe we can bring masks to hospitals near you!

"Hello, My name is Diane. I'm 35 years old. I had Wide Excision surgery of skin and subcutaneous tissue for hidradenitis, left axillary. Hidradenitis Suppurativa started when I was 12 and has affected me mentally physically and emotionally. I have seen numerous doctors and dermatologists. There's no cure for HS. I'm hoping this will help they did surgery on my left arm. Once I recover fully they will proceed with my right arm. It's a long road to recovery but I'm hopeful. I have a full time job, it's just me and my 2 teenage sons. I have no other type of income. I don't have any PTO hours I can use because I was out for 1 week for another procedure related to HS. I'm asking for help if you can. It's greatly appreciated. I will be out of work 3 to 4 weeks and I live paycheck to paycheck and I have bills to pay. Not to mention I owe $7900 for the surgery that's after my insurance. I have to go to wound care one a week. I just need help to keep us afloat until I can go back to work.",optimism

"On Friday, December 23, 2022, my husband of 50 years suffered a stroke. It was a scary situation as I found him on the floor that morning unable to move. I called my son for help and he was able to assist him as well, my husband's body was just not cooperating. We immediately called 911 and they dispatched the EMT, where 6 men had to get him off the floor, down the stairs, and into the ambulance. He was rushed to Little Company of Mary, where he endured various tests to determine he had in fact endured a stroke.

After a nine-day hospital stay, he was released to one of the best rehabilitation centers in the city, but he will need to conduct outpatient therapy once he completes rehabilitation. Our family has created this page to ask for help with Kevin's outpatient care, transportation, and overall assistance to his well-being as he continues to heal.

My husband has always been in great shape. As a retired American professional basketball player, he played eleven seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and led the league in assists four times in his pro career. He's an avid golf player and loves to spend time with his athletic grandchildren, so needless to say this situation caught us by surprise and hit us hard. Yet we trust God to heal him completely and we thank all of those who will assist us with this campaign. - Cleota Porter",fear
"Hello to you reading this request. I am very grateful that you are taking the time to stop at my post. I hope you find this a legitimate request and decide to give. My name is Cherri. I am 54 years old and have been a kidney transplant patient for 30 years. My mother, who passed away in 2005, was my donor. And even though she passed, part of her lived on in me as long as it could.

That being saidâ¦ I am needing a new kidney soon. Even though the donor does not incur any medical bills from the giving of this life saving gift, there are still major worries about being off work for recovery. Probably about 6-8 weeks.
We are hoping my youngest son (Nick Clements) can be the donor. But even if it works out to be anyone else-we hope to have funds so that this person will not have to struggle financially during recovery with no pay.

Money will be used for this purpose as well as incidentals incurred in our almost 3 hour drive back and forth to University of Michigan-where transplant will be done.

Please feel free to make inquiries with me. I am willing to answer any questions. I feel if I make this request any longer people will lose interest and stop reading.

I thank you from the bottom of my heart. God Bless",optimism

"I am writing this to all the swimmers and their parents in Maryland and to those who would like to support a very young and hard working coach.

Coach Trevor Rill always volunteers and often serves as a head Marshall at almost all of the swim meets in Maryland. That often means he is the first person on deck to make sure the swim meet is setup properly, and the last person to leave, often cleaning the mess left by swimmers like me. 

A few months ago, we were ambivalent to find out that after seven years with JCC team, coach Trevor would be leaving to become a head coach for The Ocean Pines Swim Team. A week or so later, we were shocked to learn that Trevor was diagnosed with cancer and would be starting chemotherapy immediately.

Trevorâs mom, Judy, is our teamâs administrator and a well-known Maryland Swimming official who is helping our sport tremendously. She is already facing many medical bills and we all want to support her. We reach out to our entire swimming community and beyond, asking to support Coach Trevor and his family through this difficult time in their lives. Any contribution would be deeply appreciated and will help Coach Trevor's speedy recovery.

"Hey everyone, as some of you know Aria has been sick for a few days now. We brought her into the Emergency Room yesterday evening 11/10 because she had a drop in her oxygen levels and her symptoms seemed to be getting worse. She was tested for RSV there and the test came back positive. They started to monitor her oxygen levels to find that her oxygen was quite low and they determined that due to her levels that it would be best for her to get onto oxygen and be transferred to Childrenâs Hospital for observation. We are here now and they are monitoring her and keeping track of her oxygen levels. It sounds like we are probably going to have to stay another night which is crummy, but we will continue to do whatâs best for our girl. This has been such a terrifying experience as a parent. Weâre so stressed and worried about our little girl, but now on top of that, we are stressed and worried about the financial strain this will cause. DJ lost his job a little while back and we do not currently have a large source of income. We are asking please for prayers, and good vibes, and really any help you can give.

"Hi, my name is Austin Warner, Jr.

I am a husband, father and grandfather. I have had the privilege of making Bermuda my forever home for over forty years, during which time it was my pleasure to be employed in Residential Services, King Edward Memorial Hospital (Medical Social Worker), Guidance Counseling, Addictive Services, Turning Point, Benedict Associates (EAP), Council Partners Charitable Trust. The employment opportunities have provided me with an indescribable sense of joy, especially as I have witnessed countless clients and students become awesome leaders across the Island.

Unfortunately, my current situation is a challenging one both physically, mentally and spiritually. In the past ten years I have been hospitalized over ten times, had seven surgeries, and suffered a close call with sepsis which would have killed me. I have been unable to maintain gainful employment, especially since my recent diagnoses of cardiomyopathy and pulmonary fibroses have left me with minimal walking range and challenged breathing. Prescription medications fill my nightstand, only minimizing symptoms and at times creating additional issues.

I have an opportunity to attend a wholistic healthcare treatment facility (Uchee Pines Institute) that has an outstanding reputation for healing mind, body and spirit with extraordinary outcomes. Insurance companies do not recognize their modes of treatment, hence, I am asking friends to financially help me as best you can.

My financial goal is $7,000, and as I mentioned earlier, your kind support would be greatly appreciated.

"Millions of people across the globe were shocked to see Damar Hamlin experience Sudden Cardiac Arrest on national TV during the Buffalo Bills game on January 2nd. Unfortunately, this is all too familiar to so many families including the Stephens Family.

Scott Stephens and Melody Stephens founded the Cody Stephens Foundation in 2012 after the untimely death of their son to Sudden Cardiac Arrest. At 6'9 and 290lbs, Cody was an athlete and the picture of health. When his parents found out that a simple ECG screening could have possibly saved his life, they made it their mission to allow all youth to receive an ECG. Since Cody's death, the Cody Stephens Foundation has provided over 160,000 youth with ECG heart screenings and passed HB76, Cody's Law, which gives parents the option on their school physicals form to ask for their child to receive an ECG heart screening.

Next month Scott and former NFL player, Randy Grimes, will team up during Super Bowl Week in Pheonix, Arizona to continue to raise awareness for Sudden Cardiac Arrest. This trip is an important step in advocacy for Sudden Cardiac Arrest but will cost money between flights, hotels, and printed materials. Funds donated will help with associated costs for the trip. Any additional funds will be used to continue to provide ECG heart screenings to youth.",surprise

I've been to a Urologist, but now a pure kidney specialist, because I was denied water for long periods of times.He's a Nephrologist and had a heart to heart with me, amazed I survived. He's treating me aggressively, expensive medication and temporary dialysis to avoid permanent dialysis or a transplant.I am so scared worried and most of all stressed. I have $180 in co-pays ue to the ER, $250 due to Gold Cross Ambulance, and as of today, a minimum of $1,500 to get things going to fix these kidneys! I believe in miracles, love, kindness and compassion. Any amount would help, even $5 or $10; it all adds up eventually. PS~I do not like asking for help, but I love giving help. If you're not able to give, I understand, I'd really appreciate your kind thoughts. Sending so much love to all of you.",fear

"Thanksgiving day this year was wonderful. Our family got together at my parents' house in a way that hasn't happened since Covid. We laughed, we ate, we played. This Thanksgiving will be one I will remember forever because that will be the last normal day for our family.

On Friday November 25th, my Daddy went into cardiac arrest. 911 arrived quickly, started CPR, and transported him to the hospital. After a long fight by some amazing first responders, my Daddy regained a pulse. After 5ish days in a comma, he has slowly started to regain physical strength, although his cognitive abilities are progressing much slower. He is currently in the ICU and when ready will be transferred to an in-patient rehab facility.

Both my mom and dad are still working full time. My dad has been working as a public defender helping those who need it most, and my mom teaches at a local private Christian school. My mother is a strong woman who remains steadfast in her faith, but between lost wages and medical bills, anything you are willing to give would be greatly appreciated. My hope is that through these donations she feels our love and prayers in the form of relieving some of her financial burdens.

Most importantly, please continue to lift up both my mom and dad through your prayers. God's love has brought us this far, and we trust He will continue to carry us through this storm.

"Hi everyone, we are so extremely thankful for all of the prayers this past month. For those of you that donât know my dad had a stroke 11/15/22, it was a very scary time for our family we werenât sure if my dad was going to survive but by the grace and miracles of God, my dad survived. He has a long road ahead of him, he needs physical therapy and occupational therapy, which the out of pocket just for physical therapy is $4,500, plus co-pay of $20 each visit. This isnât including all of the hospital bills that are starting to come in.

"Hi, my name is Joyce Merchant. I'm fundraising for my daughter, Jennifer McLaren.

Jennifer, her husband and two teenage sons live in Anaheim, CA.
Jennifer has been suffering from headaches that were getting worse, so she went in to have them checked out, receiving some concerning news on May 27. Since then, she's had MRIs and an angiogram (during which she had a seizure during recovery). Her driver's license has been pulled due to the seizure.
On June 29th, the neurosurgeon made an urgent referral to UCLA. The recommendation is for a conscious craniotomy so that they can check for deficits during the procedure.
The expected recovery time after the procedure is a minimum of three months, during which time she will be unable to work.
The family is struggling during this scary time as Jennifer deals with the issues with this medical issue!

Any help would be appreciated!",fear
"Hey you guys. As most of you know, my dad Stephen has been in the hospital since Christmas morning struggling to breathe. He has been diagnosed with COPD and congestive heart failure on top of asthma which heâs had since birth. He has been having several tests done and has multiple procedures planned in the next few weeks. He is an on the road truck driver and the sole provider for my family which will affect our lives moving forward. He will not be able to get back on the road for a while and we donât have an answer as to when he will be home. We are asking for prayers during this rough time as we hope he finds the strength to overcome this and there will be adjustments that we will have to take as a family to provide for him. We appreciate all of the prayers we have received and we hope that this is just a minor bump in the road for him. Any expenses donated will go directly to his medical bills and expenses, living expenses for the family, and medical supplies he will need at home moving forward. -The Hickey Family",optimism

"Jose and I received difficult news this fall that his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. This week, she began aggressive treatment to beat this cancer. While we remain positive and hopeful, it is difficult for Jose to not be near his mom as she undergoes this battle (she lives in Puerto Rico). In order for him to be with her in a sense, he has decided to shave his head and have a custom wig created from his own hair for her to wear as she undergoes chemotherapy and recovery. Just like Samson, it is his hope that his hair can give her strength and a reminder that he is with her always in her battles. Unfortunately, this process is a bit pricey - $1600. We are hoping our friends and family could contribute to this cause and help us bring a bit of strength and hope to Kamila as she undergoes this process.

"Hi there.  We are raising money for Ed Birmingham, who is my brother in-law and who is very special to our family. Some of you may know Ed through my sister Shari, some of you grew up with him in Dormont, and many of you know him as part owner of the fabulous Ivy Inn. 

Ed had previously been diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer.  He has been undergoing treatment for some time now. 

Recently, Ed has started treatment out in Arizona. It is a specialized treatment which incorporates other unique treatments along with chemotherapy. 

Ed and Shari are paying out of pocket for these treatments, as they are not covered by insurance, and we are very hopeful they will give Ed additional time with our family. 

We are asking for any donations you can make to help with the unexpected costs, which include traveling weekly from Las Vegas (where they are staying with his sister) to Scottsdale, Arizona, where they need to stay every Monday through Friday during his treatments. As a resort area, it turns out that Scottsdale can be a little pricy for hotels and then the meals on top of that. 

Ed and Shari have always been generous in helping others, so we would greatly appreciate any help you can offer at this time to help make things a little easier on them. ",optimism
"Hello/ my name is Debbie Hansen. I was hoping it would not come to this but/ I need to ask for help. On Sept 23.2022/ I found out I had two aneurysms in my head. One month later, the largest of the two was clamped to avoid bursting {see picture}. I am out of work for another month, and my disability check does not begin to cover my regular bills, let alone the Massive Medical bills that have started to appear. Adding insult to injury, Jim {my husband, the photographer} had a heart attack the same week and had to have surgery. He is doing better, and so am I, but the stress of the bills is no good for either of us. Hopefully, I will find out on the 28th when the other aneurysm will be taken care of.

"On Oct 3 Rene was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath. We would have never thought we would receive the news we did. After being in the hospital almost 3 weeks and many test later he was diagnosed with End Stage/ Stage 5 Kidney Disease. We had so many emotions, questions, and what would be our next step for our future as Rene is our backbone! Heâs our main provider for the boys and I so hearing all this was such a shock. We also learned that he would be needing dialysis and a transplant ASAP. Heâs currently out of work for the moment as he was hospitalized a second time while trying to have the procedure for the PD catheter as he had been retaining a lot of fluid again and it had reached his lungs once again which was causing shortness of breath. The next few months will be hard as we transition into dialysis and the changes that come with it. We have always been a team and we can and will overcome this together as a family. Even with insurance we have many copays and with the uncertainty of him ever returning to work it has become a challenge financially as life doesnât stop.

"Hello.

As many of you know, my mom was diagnosed with Lymphoma a few weeks ago. This week she begins treatment and it will continue for the next 4 to 6 months. We are hopeful for a positive outcome and overwhelmed by all that are praying and journeying with our family and especially with my mom.

The road ahead is not an easy one but one that can be eased with your help!

All financial gifts given will go towards the following areas:

Many of you may not know but due to where we live my parents have to travel 2.5 hours every time they need to go for treatment or see a specialist. Sometimes this means staying over night in a hotel and having to pay for gas both ways, for every visit.

Also, due the nature of my mothers anaphylactic reaction to certain foods, we are unable to do a meal train of sorts and are seeking other alternatives to meet her nutrition needs that will also keep her safe and healthy over the course of the treatment.

Finally, any left over fund will go towards medical expenses unable to be covered by insurance.

Once again, from her daughters lips to your ears, we are beyond grateful for everyone journeying with us and just last night shared with one another how we feel the physical presence of each of you.

Sincerely,
Carrie

"I have had several people reach out to me about a way to give money while mom is in the hospital.
Mom and dad have been very active in the local community since I was a kid giving and doing every chance they get both locally and international. Mom has been a Sunday school teacher and dad has been a preacher/ pasture for most of my life and would give you the shirt off their back if you needed it.
Neither of them were too accepting to gofundme when I first mentioned it but since people have reached out recently they have allowed me to push forward with the account since it's the easiest way for me to manage any funds anyone would like to give.
Mom has been in the hospital since Thursday and will hopefully get out this up coming week however we have discovered that her insurance does not cover a lot of the bill and the unpaid medical bills will be substantial. I have filled out paperwork to hopefully at least get the bills reduced but will not be able to turn it in until Monday at the soonest.
Any and all funds raised will be used to pay medical bills, travel expenses, and utility bills.
My dad is the only income in the home since mom had breast cancer 2 years ago and has now taken time off work to be there for mom. Any money given is greatly appreciated.",optimism

"Hello everyone, Iâm posting on behalf of one of my cousins who's more like a sister to me. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the case, I'm unable to release her name at the moment. On Thursday, January 5th, 2023 shortly after midnight, a domestic violence incident with her boyfriend resulted in severe gun shot wounds, which left her in a life-threatening situation. Their 14-year-old son (whose name I'm unable to release) woke up to the sound of gun shots. Shortly after he went outside of the apartment complex, to find his mom laying there severly wounded with several gunshots. 911 was called, and she was rushed to the ER where emergency surgery was performed. Yesterday, on January 6th, 2023 a second emergency surgery was performed as severe internal bleeding was occurring due to the amount of damage from the bullet wounds. She is fighting hard, not just for herself but for her 14-year-old son. She's stable, but said to be in the hospital for what they're saying is a long time.

"Our family friendsâ son, Liam, is a fantastic 9-year-old kid recently diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. Liamâs early years were full of joy and laughter--until November of 2021, when he started having difficulty standing, walking and climbing the stairs. At first, his parents thought it was just a mild sprain, but then gradually, it became worse; after consulting pediatric neurologists about his case, and a series of tests, Liam was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy.

It has been a long and challenging road for Liam and everyone who loves him. Thankfully, Lurie Childrenâs Hospital, one of the best pediatric hospitals in the world, has accepted him into their care!

Soon, Liam and his parents will be able to travel from the Philippines to Chicago for consultation and treatment. Access to the best medical care is a privilege many of us take for granted daily. For Liam and his parents, this trip will be life-changing and hopefully give Liam many more happy years to be a healthy and happy kid.

As you can imagine, this kind of care involves tremendous expense. While Liamâs parents are working with Lurie to learn of any financial assistance available, I am kindly calling on the generosity of my family and friends. Anything you can do to help will be forever appreciated by Liam, his parents, and myself.

Letâs get Liam well this holiday season.",joy
"A post recently popped up in one of the Land Rover groups on Facebook. The post was looking for advice. A gentleman named Kris was looking to get an appraisal on the value of his pride and joy, 88â Series 2a Land Rover as he was wanting to sell it. The reasonâ¦ his wife Narelle had spent the last two years trying to kick cancers ass.

The fantastic news is that Narelle has beaten the odds and is thankfully currently in remission! This hasnât taken the burden off though, and Kris was considering selling his pride and joy to take some of the financial strain off the family.

2 years on 1 salary is financially hard for most trying to support 4 children and 2 grandchildren, but Kris told me that heâd honesty rather be in a tent if it meant that Narelle and him could still be together.

A group of equally as avid Land Rover lovers, after reading his post, decided that they would prefer that Kris kept his car. Starting this fundraiser was decided to be the best course of action to help ease the stress on the family. If you can even donate a couple of dollars, collectively we could seriously help out a family and let a Land Rover lover keep his pride and joy he rebuilt from the ground up himself!",joy

I have a drain in and my rent is covered for 2 months but I managed to get my account into the negatives. Im just hoping that in all the holiday madness I can get help to get my account out of the negative and I don't want to ask for more than that. If you want more details feel free to contact me. Anything helps, even a friend :)",optimism

These last two years have been rough dealing with multiple injuries to my right knee. I tore it September of 2021 and got it fixed soon after, I came back last year in May and was able to ride 2 month before re-tearing it again in July. I had my second surgery for it in July of 2022 and I need one more surgery before I can come back. This will be my third surgery and hopefully my last!

Hi! My name is Barb Bishop. Two weeks ago i began my new journey into dialysis. In early 2022 I woke up in hospital after two weeks of not remembering anything to being told I was lucky to be alive. I have thanked God every day for allowing me life. My bone is not producing ted blood cells and my potassium went so high it immobilized my body. Thus my kidneys were affected and over the past have s functioning. I have spent the past year doing trhan to het some muscle strength back but it is certainly a challenge. I can longer drive due to the muscle loss and there is so much more to this journey. I need assistance getting to and from dialysis 3 times a week. Medicare does not cover this cost and admittedly I am afraid. I checked companies who do private medical transport and it will be challenging and costly. I am asking for help until I figure this all out. I am humbled by my needs.,fear

"Hi everyone, Iâm back at it again with another ask. I hate asking, but Iâm entering the toughest (and undoubtedly most expensive) part of my health journey yet.

I was just diagnosed with a rare form of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, specifically known as Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, ALK-Positive. Iâve already racked up more than a few doctor bills, and I havenât even started treatment yet! It has taken 6 doctor appointments (regular and specialist), 2 x-rays, a CT scan, an ultrasound FNA needle biopsy, an urgent care visit, 2 emergency room visits, a brief hospital stay, and a surgical laryngoscopy with biopsy to even get a diagnosis. Next will be more tests, including a PET scan, to determine staging and the extent of where the cancer has spread in my body. Then, I will likely be doing chemotherapy.

To top this all off, I have been too sick to work for over a month, lost my job due to the number of days I missed, and I will be unable to work for the foreseeable future while I am in treatment. 

Whew! That was a lot. Again, I hate to ask, but if youâre in a position to donate even a couple dollars, it would definitely be a huge help. All my love to you all, alwaysâ¤ï¸",anger

"Hello to all, and thanks for reading our story. Very rarely does a person come along that makes you realize they were exactly what you needed. This person to us is Mrs. Dianne Coach Lemus. She is truly a superhero in the flesh. She is a wife and mother, teacher and coach, mentor and friend. She unselfishly dedicates most of her life to making somebody else's life better. And she is currently in the cardiac wing of Scott and White, waiting on promising results from the new meds or facing heart surgery due to post-COVID cardiac complications.
The road ahead for Dianne is uncertain and likely to be tough. So under the suggestion of one of her soccer girls, Taylor, and the unrelenting support of our entire soccer family, we decided to try this to alleviate some of the financial burdens that come with extended hospital stays, surgeries and recovery. We ask you all to open your hearts (and wallets) to help one of our favorite hearts if you can.
We welcome all thoughts, well wishes and prayers, too!
Thanks Again,

"Our beautiful friend Stephanie. Full of love and light and everything good. Always there to lend a helping hand. Now itâs our turn.

Stephanie is 53 years old and the mother of six. She works full time as a sales representative for our local newspaper. Earlier this year, Stephanie was diagnosed with stage three rectal cancer. Her prognosis is good, but her treatment plan is extensive and long going. Chemotherapy treatments began in mid-September and will continue until mid-January at which time she will continue chemotherapy and begin daily radiation treatments for another six weeks. This will require either daily travel or lodging near the medical center.  Our hope is that at the end of her treatments, the tumor will have shrunken enough to be operable.

Stephanie is continuing to work as much as possible but will be able to work less and less as treatments continue. We live in a small community, and she must travel 150 miles (round trip) for each treatment. We have started a GoFundMe page in the hopes of helping our friend Stephanie raise money for medical, travel, and living expenses until she can get back on her feet. We love our friend dearly and would love to take some of the financial burden off her and her children.

If you feel it in your heart to donate, we would greatly appreciate it.",love

You may know me as Michael or Herdy or Daddy in some circles but I'm coming to you out of last resort desperation and incredible hostility towards the American healthcare system. Those who know me very well know I embarked on a journey to obtain bariatric surgery, the journey has been arduous and to date, fruitless. I have started researching surgery tourism and have found some very reputable surgeons in Mexico and with your help, I'm ready to just jump the bullet.

I have struggled with weight issues since I was a child. I've always been the husky kid and things just got more out of hand during Covid when I became a shut-in with the rest of the world and ballooned in weight. It's affecting my mental health in addition to the obvious physical ramifications and I'm looking for a change and a fresh start which is what I feel this surgery will provide. I really hate asking for help and anybody who knows me knows how difficult it is for me to do so but this is truly the boost I need to get the fresh start in life I so desperately need.",anger

Phew, I have always managed to get by with my creativity with little, but due to my illness it is now temporarily not feasible to pay the bills.

I am unexpectedly very ill, because of my thyroid and need time to recover really well So that I can share all my love, wisdom and expertise again with the children and people around me.
Recovery takes about 6 to 8 weeks.

Unfortunately though, I have a lump on my right shoulder that has been small in nature, but over the years, has gotten bigger to the point that I need to have it removed. It doesn't hurt me or cause me any pain, but I know if time progresses, that it will start to impair my way of life.

"Hi, my name is Chris Hager. I am setting up a Go Fund Me account to raise money for medical expenses for my nephew, Devin. On the night of Dec. 26 Devin was trapped overnight by a huge tree that fell on his vehicle while at a campsite in northern California. His rescue required the coordinated effort of dozens of people and multiple agencies. His legs were pinned, crushed and severely injured. The link to the rescue story is attached below. He is currently in ICU in Eureka, CA under the care of multiple surgeons attempting to save his lower left leg. Thank you all for asking what you can do and how you can help.

"Hello my name is Andrew Ray and my fiance, Taylor Hosey recently got diagnosed with a rare bone and soft tissue cancer, Ewings Sarcoma. She is currently 5 weeks out from graduating nursing school, we were 2 months out from our wedding, and two months out from moving to a new city. This was completely unexpected. She had surgery in December to remove what we thought was a benign mass, that ended up resulting in this diagnosis. She will be started chemo on January 31st and will be doing 14 rounds of aggressive intense chemotherapy, and we were told she would lose her hair about two weeks into treatment. She has always had long beautiful hair as you can see in the picture, and losing her hair has been something she is really upset about in this process. We have been looking at human hair wigs but they are over 2000 for a wig that would look similar to her hair. We are looking to raise money that would go towards the cost of a nice human hair wig that she can use for the next year while she undergoes chemo. Any donation, thoughts or prayers are appreciated.

"Hi, Iâm Jonathan and I need help staying home. December 5th I celebrated turning 67. I made it! I was hospitalized with COVID on my birthday and while there I learned I had cancer. My partner was in tears but vowed to care for me. Weâd beat cancer before. When I came home from the hospital my partner was missing. I looked and looked. After days I got the call. While walking our dog Max a car fatally collided with my dearest friend. I still canât believe the loss. Max survived but the both of us are completely devastated. Grieving while doctors searched for a diagnosis hasnât been easy. After several long hospital stays we now know that I have a rare kidney cancer. This was hard news for me because doctors had an image of the mass a full year ago and didnât tell me. I still believe, however, that all things work together for good. Being home is a good place for me now. I was so very cold while at the hospital. I just want to be home and warm. I love you all and thank you for calling me even when I couldnât always answer. You are invaluable to me and we have shared so much together. We are still sharing and loving one another; even now.

"Hi, My name is Miranda Winkleman, and I am fundraising for my mom Alice Spooner, that was just diagnosed with Breast and Uterus cancer. She went in for a blood clot, and when they did the CT scans, they determined there was possibly more, so they started doing biopsies, and so far, two biopsies have come back that she has breast and uterus cancer. She has another appointment on November 14th to Dakota Dunes, November 16th to Sioux Falls and then on the 17th to Sioux City. She cannot drive herself due to having to drink some stuff and having an IV injected, so that is three days of lost wages for both her and her husband, along with all the other pending appointments she will need to do to remove cancer. It sounds like she will have to be out of work for two weeks with the breast cancer treatment and six weeks for the uterus cancer. She also still has appointments to check for liver and blood cancer- hopefully, those results will be good. We will keep everyone informed as things progress, but I am very hopeful that once the treatments are completed, she will be cancer free!

"**UPDATE**

After spending a Merry Christmas surrounded by her loving husband and two boys, Margaret found her speech inexplicably slurred. Alarmed, her husband took her to the hospital.

What happened next, could only be described as earth shattering. Within hours, the seemingly healthy Margaret was suffering from seizures which immediately impacted her ability to move and speak normally. A short time later it was discovered that she had not one, but four masses in her brain.

A terrified, but determined Justin Mussel searched for answers and solutions for his wife. After concluding that the best chance for Margaretâs recovery meant transporting her to a different hospital with a team of tenured specialists, Justin had her moved to a hospital with specialty in what she is facing.

Since being transferred, Margaret has undergone a biopsy that lead to a daunting diagnosis. Doctors concluded that Margaret has several rare masses. Justin is steadfastly searching to find innovative treatments and procedures that will guide his bride down the road to a full recovery and a long and healthy life with their family.

Hi my name is Kayla. My mom recently had to go through emergency surgery. This was so unexpected. She she has been stuck in the hospital since last week. She is self employed so there is no short term disability. My mom is everything to us. She takes care of everyone and everything. She always gives her last and now she is in a situation of not only not being able to work but has no income at all coming in. The funds would be used for bills and medical supplies that she needs to heal. I have attached pictures... Some are gruesome. But I wanted everyone to see that she is in a lot of pain and really needs help.,surprise
"Hello everyone!
Iâve been in dire straits ever since I had developed stage 4 kidney disease and now I may be looking into getting a new kidney which may prove hard. I had reached out to family but they seem to be more consumed in their needs so now I look to you.. my family on social media. I hate asking for help AGAIN but it seems to be getting worse. I have to call in from work a lot because of my disease so I lose money every day. I sell a lot of my stuff on eBay to make up for it but I still canât make ends meet. So now I reach out to those who want to help. I feel bad that I must do this but I donât know where to turn! I need help and can only ask. Donât feel obligated. I understand. Sharing helps too, esp prayers. Help my worries lax just a bit. But I tell you, itâs not a fun disease. Donât get it! Take care of yourself regardless! Always.. and thank you.",anger

"Hello. My name is Harry.

About four years ago, my single mother was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer in her abdomen. She has undergone chemotherapy and surgery in her stomach to remove cancer, which succeeded.

Then about two years ago, she suffered a seizure stroke. During the emergency room visit for this, it was discovered that her cancer was still there. However, it had metastasized to her brain, which caused the seizure stroke. She then underwent two sessions of whole-brain radiation, but sadly the attempts were unsuccessful, and she now has over 25 lesions in her brain, and there are no further treatments they can provide.

With the rate of inflation every day and the rising medical costs, I am struggling to cover her medical expenses for the care she needs for the nursing home and other financial responsibilities.

I'm never one to ask for help but hear I am at my last resort to ask for any assistance.",sadness
"A sudden shock; a special Mom and family who remain a bright, supporting light for their friends, family and community.


Recently diagnosed with Renal Cell Carcinoma, Lizzie will have surgery to remove a tumor and a good portion of one of her kidneys. This moment brings a clear and immediate threat to the family's well-being. Not only do they face a strong fear for their loving wife and mother's health, but also for the financial damage of medical expenses, lost wages, lodging, meals and excessive travel (3 hours/ each round trip).

As many of you know, this trial came for the Pattons, right at the tail end of other extreme challenges. It also happened amidst their daughter Maddison's strive to raise money and awareness for breast cancer. This GoFundMe was created via Maddie's initiative.

So many of us have found individual and communal support with Liz and her family. Now is our chance to give a heartfelt thank you by supporting them in return.

You can also give via Venmo

"This Go Fund Me has been started to help the Dozier family out to get through a difficult time that has unexpectedly happened. On January 13th Alyssa was taken by ambulance because she was having trouble speaking. After extensive testing it was determined that Alyssa has several leisons on her spine, in addition to having several on her brain. The diagnosis is Multiple Sclerosis. The family has made the difficult decision to have Alyssa transferred to the Cleveland Clinic, which presents more problems as Derrick won't be able to work consistently as he has to split his time between Cleveland and their 3 small children, Beau, Blake and June. The generosity of this fund will go towards expenses that the Dozier family will encounter, such as living expenses, gas to go back and forth to Cleveland and any other unexpected financial burden that will crop up. This will be a long process as the family struggles to adjust to their new normal. They of course thank you in advance for any help you can offer.",surprise

"      Christine and Zach were married in May, living in honeymoon bliss. But sadly, tragedy struck on Tuesday night, August 17th. Around 9 p.m. Zach finished making a delivery for work on 3rd and Christian in Philadelphia, where he was attacked and brutally beaten by a group of teenagers on bicycles.
From the point of view of an eyewitness, he was pulled from his car, thrown down and beaten on his head. He has undergone emergency brain surgery at Jefferson Hospital to stop the bleeding in his brain.
Zach is getting excellent care, but he is in critical condition. The next days and weeks will be important as they assess the level of swelling and bleeding in his brain, and more seriously the long-term impact.
This kind and gentle young man is fighting for his life and we need all of your support.
Itâs been very hard for Christine and her loved ones to process the senselessness of this unprovoked attack and the way things change so dramatically in an instant.
We ask to please pray for Zach, and to support them during this hardship in the weeks and months ahead.

"On Monday, Lynneâs beautiful dog Dotty was savagely attacked by a large, dangerous dog while out on an afternoon walk.
Dotty joined the family as a companion for Ernie, Lynneâs long-time canine best friend. Sadly, Lynne lost Ernie to age-related illness just a few months ago, and Dotty has been a consistent joy for Lynne during such a sad time.
Now, Lynne is facing losing Dotty too, who is only a young dog, but has fast become a loyal friend.
As this was an attack beyond anyoneâs control (the dog, while dangerous, had inadvertently been released from its normal secure yard with beware of dog warnings), Lynne now faces thousands of dollars in vet bills as the team at AHVEC desperately try to help Dotty pull through multiple surgeries.
Currently, she is in a stable yet critical condition, with the possibility of spending weeks in their care if she makes it through the procedures.
We know itâs Christmas time, which isnât ideal to be asking for donations, but if you are in a position to do so, we would be so grateful for any contributions to this GoFundMe to start to cover some of the expensive vet bills.",sadness
"Dear family and friends,

We are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved, Sean Monterrosa, who passed away on June 2, 2020. He was a wonderful son, brother, a friend who touched the lives of those around him. He was loyal, hard-working, and had a heart of gold. He was truly one of a kind.  

Sean was unarmed, nonviolent, and surrendering when he was shot and killed by officer Jarrett Tonn of Vallejo PD through the backseat of an unmarked pickup truck with an AR-15. The unmarked pickup truck hadn't even stopped when shots were fired. We now have civil rights and police brutality attorney, John Burris taking on the case. 

Sean was robbed of his community. He was an active member of the San Francisco/Bay Area community. He worked and attended various youth programs such as MYEEP, BGCSF, 7TEEPEES, HORIZONS ULTD, DJ PROJECT, and finished his program at Job Train in Menlo Park as a carpenter. 

Our family is mourning his loss, and we are all devastated. Sean has been put to rest on June 19, 2020, we want to thank everyone who contributed and helped bring awareness to his story. 

Many have been asking how they can financially support our family as we undergo a long fight for justice. Sean was a key provider for our household and his absence has taken a toll. If it's in your heart to help bless this family, may God remunerate you abundantly. 



Thank you, everyone and God bless you.

"Hello, due to the inactivity of the public administration I have been forced to create this Go fund me.

I briefly explain my situation.

I live on a street that is heavily trafficked by tourists, who come to have fun, get drunk and leave garbage. The agglomeration of my street is due to the existence of two places that are making my life impossible.
So that you understand me, they have the music and the microphone at full volume, from Monday to Sunday, from morning until dawn. At home, it seems that they are singing in my ear.
This has made me have to stop studying for oppositions, because there is no corner in my own house where I find silence and tranquility. Anxiety attacks and migraines have been my day to day, which has led me to take medication to be able to live in my home. In addition, to make rest and a dignified life impossible.

Please help me, no matter how little, it's already something. I need to be able to live quietly in my house. I'm very scared, I don't want to relive the same thing next summer. I have hit rock bottom. I want to recover my mental health, I want to heal. The only possibility that I have in my hands is to soundproof the house, but I do not have the economic capacity to do it...

I have tried by all means to get Palma City Council to do something, but when it does, it will be too late.

Thank you very much from the heart.

Shannon is an absolute cornerstone of our community, having grown up locally in the Shields Valley. As anyone who knows Shannon can attest, her biggest joy in life is being with her two amazing boysâboth of which are incredibly lucky to have such a dedicated and loving mother.

"Hello all, Iâm Tobias. Iâve never done this sort of thing before, but Iâm finally taking the advice of friends and strangers to ask for your help. I have many difficult mental health conditions, including CPTSD and neurodivergency, which have in turn developed into fibromyalgia. My ability to walk has been degrading in the past year due to severe fatigue, pain, and weakness, and Iâve very reluctantly accepted the idea that a cane is no longer enough for me, and I need a wheelchair. My world keeps getting smaller, and now I canât even walk or stand without pain. I want more freedom, even if it means relying on a chair sometimes. This has been very hard to accept.

Unfortunately, Iâm unable to work right now, and my boyfriend can only barely afford to support us, even with financial gifts from my family. Medicaid doesnât want to cover me here in NC. I hate to ask even more of anyone after how generous people have already been, but I hate to imagine being trapped at home as the weather gets nicer. I miss going on walks.

If you could spare any amount of money, weâd be extremely grateful. I set the amount for $500, but anything helps, and anything that doesnât go toward the chair will contribute to food and medication.

Thank you so much. <3

This family struggled for a few years & fought to keep their son alive as a BMT survivor. They spent months in the hospital with their little boy. Jeremiah is now five and in school, but still has challenges.

Just when they thought life was on the mend, their world changed again. Mark Upshaw was diagnosed with throat cancer & had to begin treatment immediately.

This diagnosis shook the family to its core! Mark has begun cancer treatment, but his inability to work and provide for his family comes with that. His wife Melissa has to stay close to their son's school in case of an emergency with him. Mark has to travel more than an hour away for treatment, thus further putting stress on the budget.

Although small, this family is mighty & they could use our help now!

This gofundme will help with monthly household expenses as Mark will be out of work.",sadness
"Hey friends, this is Daniel and Treasa Sabo. Many of you know that Anya has been battling some pretty tough medical issues over the last number of years.

But we have some great news! A clear diagnosis has been found, and effective treatment has been offered. The only challenge left is to raise funds to get the treatment started.

If you love these guys like we do and want to be a part of helping to achieve this goal, we encourage you to do so!

For over 13 years, Anya has wrestled with what we now know as Lyme disease. We are so grateful to have answers and the option for an aggressive therapy known as Supportive Oligonucleotide Therapy (SOT). This therapy targets the specific bacteria and blocks their ability to continue replicating, resulting in the eventual die-off of the Lyme bacteria over 6 to 8 months. Such an encouraging discovery for treatment!

Love you all, and we are so thankful that you would consider standing with us to support our dear friends at this time!

"On 12/16, the cornerstone of our family, Pam George, suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm. She was rushed by ambulance to Mosaic for a CT scan, then immediately life-flighted to KU Medical for surgery. The surgery went incredibly well and we are still hoping for a full recovery. My father retired just two months ago and she is now on supplemental insurance/Medicare. With the life flight and surgery plus 2-3 weeks of care, we are trying to shoulder some of the burder of the medical bills that will be coming so that they can still somewhat enjoy retirement. If you are able, please donate what you can. 100% of everything will go directly to Roger and Pam.",optimism
"We all know Michael as a super tall, often cranky, lovable and down to earth guy. Heâs always there to lend a hand, bring the beers and man the bbq when needed. Heâs someone who would give you the shirt off his back, and doesnât ask for anything in return.

In October, Michael was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkinâs Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL), located in his bone marrow. While not curable, this type of cancer is treatable but will entail a long and arduous journey.


In typical Michael fashion, he is upbeat, ready to fight and kick this cancer to the curb, but he will need our support to do it!

His treatment plan will involve a combination of chemotherapy, other medications/steroids and getting blood to bring up his white blood cell counts over the next 6-9 months. With the loss of energy and side effects of starting treatment, he has had to stop working and will not likely be able to return for some time. Being self-employed, access to benefits and financial options are unfortunately very limited, so we are hoping to raise some money to help with the costs of getting him to and from treatments (2-3 times per week) and living expenses, which will hopefully make the road to recovery a little easier on him.

Your contributions to the cause would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for supporting in any way you can.",optimism

"On June 27th, Katie and Dan welcomed their new baby boy, Cruz David Lagomarsino.  Shortly after his birth, Katie and Dan learned that Cruz was born with a heart defect.  This was a complete surprise to them as Katie experienced a normal, healthy pregnancy and delivery.

When Baby Cruz was born, he had to be immediately flown to UC Davis children's hospital in Sacramento,  where he was diagnosed with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome.  In order for him to survive, Cruz had to have a cardiac catheter stent put into his PDA vessel in lieu of the Norwood procedure on July 2, which allowed for his body to oxygenate his blood properly.  The procedure was a success and he remains in cardiac care at UC Davis.

Cruz will need two more surgeries, the Bi-Directional Glenn procedure and the Fontan procedure, to fully correct his heart defect. Both of these surgeries will be done in the next 18-24 months.

Katie and Dan are doing well under the circumstances, yet as you can imagine, costs to support their newborn baby's health condition far exceed their health insurance coverage. This campaign is to help raise money to cover Baby Cruz's life saving medical expenses.",surprise
"In September 2022, my dad Ernesto was diagnosed with prostate cancer requiring surgery. My siblings and I gathered to financially help Ernesto. A month later, my mom Juana was unexpectedly diagnosed with kidney cancer and rushed into surgery within days of her diagnosis. With both parents unexpectedly dealing with being on and off from work to attend out of town appointments and surgeries, the total of both bills has surpassed more than my siblings and I can help with financially. It is for this reason we are asking for financial help. These donations will be split between both parents to help relieve some of the burden off their shoulders of their medical bills and travel expenses as they faithfully fight cancer.
As always prayers are appreciated, and we thank you for any and all support sent to Juana and Ernesto to help keep their fighting spirits up during these difficult times.

"As some of you may know, our son Ryan has developmental delays. He is getting the help he needs with Physical Therapy, Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and will soon start ABA Therapy. He is having an extra hard time in his speech development. He is measuring about 2 months old in his speech, per his developmental doctor. We have recently discovered that he can successfully communicate to us through a tablet and app with help from both his speech and occupational therapist. This is a huge milestone for us and he was so happy to let us know what he wanted and even happier to know he could tell us. It has been recommended to us to go forward and get a tablet for him, specifically an Apple iPad as that is what is compatible with the Proloque2go AAC app. This is the app that is able to help us communicate with him and customizable for him. We are in need of a larger iPad to help him clearly see the pictures/icons as we will need to work on the smaller icons. The app, iPad, and case all add up $1300.00. We are asking for monetary donations to help pay for the cost needed to help give our son Ryan the chance to develop his communication skills. Every dollar will go directly towards this, and any amount would be greatly appreciated to achieve this goal. Thank you.",joy
"Hi, my name is Madison Erami and I am fundraising for my boyfriend, Matthew Olmstead, who recently lost his left leg due to a motor vehicle accident in April 2022. Over the last 9 months, Matt has put in an immense amount of time and effort into recovering so he can get back to living his life to the fullest. Matt really enjoys being active in his day especially when it comes to work, the gym, helping family and friends, and his outdoor hobbies. With the current prosthetic leg, he is limited in his activities. With the Moto Knee, he can get back to doing the activities he loves most. We were informed that the insurance company would not cover the cost of the prosthetic. The addition of this leg is important because seeing him thrive and having the capability to continue what he once loved greatly impacts himself and his quality of life. Furthermore, Matt will be able to reach his full potential. Any and all funds will be used to help pay for the expenses of the Moto Knee because insurance will not be covering any part of the prosthetic cost. Any donation will help and go a long way. Thank you, all is appreciated.",joy

"Mike has had a year long battle with Pancreatic Cancer and the medical bills have piled up in search of a cure. Jeannie has cared for Mike, made his healthy meals, helped him to get into a Clinical Trial and worked tirelessly on his behalf to help beat this terrible disease. Mike has fought valiantly, never giving up hope that a cure could be found, he has continued to work and provide for his family, but unfortunately the cancer has progressed to the point that Mike was paralyzed and Jeannie had been caring for him daily.

My dad, Pat Owens, has made it quite a long way since his heart attack in 1990! We got 30 great years since then! I am striving for some more time.  His heart is failing.  He has an awesome team of doctors that are optimistic they can give him more time. 
There will be a lot of back and forth travel to Baltimore and unforeseen expenses along the way.  At this point he can not work. 
My goal is to help give my parents some breathing room financially to make this adventure as stress free as possible.  If you can give a little, it will go a long way.  I'm hopeful that his doctors have a game plan to get him up to par for a heart transplant.  
Pat loves watching his grandson, Adam, play baseball.  Anyone that knows him knows how much he loves drag racing and golf!  Sundays used to be golf in the early morning and then off to the track!

"In the 5 years since our son, Cole, was diagnosed with Primary Erythromelalgia, we've been hesitant to ask for anything beyond prayers for his healing - and in that time, we've been so blessed to have had family, friends, and complete strangers from around the world reach out and wrap our family in love and support. However, the unexpected and potentially permanent decline in Cole's condition during the summer and fall of 2020 has brought us to a place we never expected: we want to do something big and meaningful to help our homebound child regain some quality of life, and this time we're unable to do it on our own. 

We know this is a BIG ask.

We've been staring at the number for weeks, wondering how we could ever ask for something so enormous -- but at ten and a half, the clock counting down to the end of Cole's childhood years sounds a lot louder than it did when he was five, and the new limitations of his condition mean the scope of his world has been reduced, likely for a very long time, to the space inside the walls of our home... so when we say this technology would mean the world to Cole, in a lot of ways we mean that literally. Please help us give Cole a new way to play, by donating or sharing his story. 

With love and gratitude,

"This weekend, I was 
rear ended in a car accident around 6.30pm Dec 9th at NW Expressway / Brookside and Wilshire area near OnCue @ Popeyes Chicken, I had my boxer dog with me. I called my brother to come pick up the dog and bc of traffic congestion he parked across the street. Walked to the accident and picked up Boomer. Very sadly they were both hit by a car, Juston was taken to the hospital and the dog took off running and disappeared for two days. The dog was found but Juston was left with nearly grave injuries.

We also found out that his employee insurance does not have short or long term disability and we have yet to see how well the medical covers but weâre told not as far as his recovery needs. I could go through the laundry list of injuries and each have to be attended to and rehabbed almost one at a time.

"Cortney and David are thrilled to welcome their son, RÃ©mi, born on January 4th. He is a beautiful little boy. Unfortunately, he has a condition where his esophagus has not fully formed, which prevents him from eating properly and will require multiple surgeries to correct it.

They will need to wait until RÃ©mi grows a bit to do the other surgery, which will be in several months. He is well cared for at Sick Kids, and his mom and dad want to be with him as much as possible during this time. For the next several months, Cortney and David will be spending most of their time in Toronto to be with RÃ©mi.

On Thanksgiving day, I suffered a heart attack and was admitted to the hospital. On a day that is usually filled with laughter and joy, I was in a hospital bed preparing for an angioplasty procedure commonly known as stent surgery.

"Hi Everyone,

Deb here. In case you don't follow my social media you may not know that I was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer that also has spread to the liver.

While initially, the hope was to be able to travel back to the US for a second opinion and possible treatments, this particular cancer creates blood clots which can be just as deadly if they travel to my lungs or heart.

We hope to raise 20k to ease the financial burden on my family who will have to travel here to see me as this disease progresses, and with funeral arrangements to bring my ashes back to the United States.

"The Kennedy family will soon be welcoming their little bundle of joy, Barrett, to the world.

"I hate to have to beg for help yet once again but Iâm in dire need of help and am just having to swallow my pride and ask for help. I had my second surgery November 17th 2022. I have had lots of complications since this surgery and am requiring another surgery sometime in the next month or two. Due to being unable to work due to this I have lost my job and my insurance. Sucks too because I had finally gotten a job I actually loved and loved going to work. I am now behind on every bill you can think of. Itâs no oneâs fault but my own due to my health so itâs no oneâs responsibility to help me at all but if you can and would like to help I would forever be great full. My last surgery was $98,000 and Iâm sure my next one will be every bit of that if not more. Jennifer bless her heart is doing all she can being the only one working but the bills are pilling up and way behind. Iâve tried to get assistance from programs but of course I donât qualify. For those of you who have helped Iâm forever grateful. Much love to all of you!",anger

"Kristen was a fighter. She didnât let a cancer diagnosis stop her from living life. She is no longer needing to fight and can Rest In Peace with no more pain.

Kristen passed away February 8th. She was a beloved wife, mother, grandmother, friend, coworker and so much more.

This cancer moved quick. Kristen tried to work until it just wasnât possible anymore. She was so selfless and just wanted to make sure that her family wasnât burdened with finances.

As we are all heartbroken losing such a beautiful soul, we are now reaching out for assistance with the funeral and overwhelming medical costs. As much as we were prepared for this, we werenât prepared for the financial burden.

"Hi, I am fundraising for my Nephew and Godson, Zachary Lewis.
Yesterday morning Zach was in a terrible car accident where a tractor-trailer struck him on the driver's side of his vehicle. He has undergone four surgeries for injuries suffered in the accident, including a splenectomy, kidney laceration, and traumatic brain injury requiring the removal of parts of his skull to relieve severe swelling and bleeding. Zach is stable but not out of the woods yet. He has not fully woken up due to severe head trauma. Still, Zach shows responsiveness by moving all four extremities, squeezing his family's hands, and moving his body around for nurses. In addition, He and his girlfriend Reagin are expecting a baby girl due on October 10. We are hoping Zach can wake up in time for the birth of his beautiful baby girl. He will be in the hospital for at least two weeks and then have a long road of recovery in a Rehabilitation Center.

Our family and friends can come together and help. If you can, please donate, share, and pray for him. With help, love and support, we can get Zach and his growing family the help they need and assist in easing the heavy burden of the coming months.",optimism

"Hey everyone, you may or may not know, my brother Jesse has been dealing with Minimal Change Disease for several years now (Minimal change disease is a kidney disorder that can lead to nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is a group of symptoms that include protein in the urine, low blood protein levels in the blood, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, and swelling.) There is a treatment to cure the disease, but it's expensive and not government funded. Rituximab, Rituxan intravenous solution (10 mg/mL), is around $999 for a supply of 10 millilitres. Jesse needs upwards of 250ml. I understand that these are hard times and not everyone can afford to help, but every tiny bit counts; I hope we can come together and help Jesse beat this disease for good so he can focus on being the father and family man he is.

"This November Harold Henley was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer that has now spread to his liver. This was very sudden and shocking to him, his wife and kids.  Harold is an amazing father of three and a dedicated husband. Besides being the friend that is always there in a momentâs notice, he has been an outstanding member of our community, participating and volunteering much of his time to helping others. When Harold isnât working countless hours in the oil field to support his family he, along with his family, lead a heathy lifestyle participating in Jiu Jitsu and regularly work out at their favorite local gym.
Harold is only 36 years young and we are asking for any donation to help the Henley family deal with the cost of the surgery that he had in November to remove the cancerous part of his colon. Another surgery is scheduled in a few weeks to remove the cancer that has spread to his liver. Intense chemotherapy will also be part of the treatment.
Harold will not be able to return to work for an undetermined amount of time. Deductibles will now have to be met this year and will need to be met again in January along with other medical expenses. Add these unexpected medical expenses along with our normal cost of living and it would be overbearing for any family.

"As some of you may know, Amanda was recently diagnosed with breast cancer, which came as a total and complete surprise. Amanda's cancer is currently diagnosed at Stage 2. She will need to undergo surgery, chemotherapy and radiation to beat this! Not only that, but, as a young woman, she will need to work with a fertility doctor prior to her treatment to ensure that she has a chance to have a family in the future, which is very important to her. These and cancer treatments can be extremely expensive. In addition to all of this, cancer treatment will likely render her unable to work for a period of time. As a trainer, her body and health are her well-being.

What is needed now? Donations for recent medical expenses related to post-brain surgery issues.

Anxiety and insomnia continue right alongside these new medical conditions she now has to deal with. I am keeping the Go Fund Me site available for any friends or family that can help with the financial worries. She continues to have out-of-pocket expenses for hospital bills, doctor visits, scans, and medications.

Many thanks to those of you that continue to reach out to her directly with supportive thoughts and inspiration. It takes an awesome support circle to get through something like this. - Nancy",joy

Her hospital charges will be partly covered by insurance, but weâre all aware of the gaps in coverage, co-pays and deductibles that add up fast.

Well, as you have likely read from Cooperâs Caring Bridge site (https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/cooperthompson ) Cooper had some pre-birth battles he was      fighting through,  he was diagnosed with LUTO, which has an impact on bladder    and kidney function.  
Cooper did his best to heal what he could before arriving, but now he needs some help.  Cooper will be starting dialysis in the next couple to help his kidneys work    their magic.  Cooper will need to continue dialysis until the time is right for a           kidney transplant, likely when he is 1. 
This obviously will not be a short or easy journey for Cooper... or Katie... or Eric...   or big sister Evelyn...  they will all need our help!

"Hello there everyone!

My name is Megan and I am having a meltdown due to the notion that my right breast has a VERY large lump in it. Cancer unfortunately happens to run in my family and I am in a large amount of distress. The lump has gotten bigger at an alarming rate but it not in pain.

I am very chicken of needles and medical equipment and professionals have always scared the bejeebus out of my since childhood.

In the last 2 weeks, my left breast has developed a lump even faster than the right. This one is excruciatingly painful and it I have never in my life seen anything like it. It grew so fast that I finally got scared enough to seek help.

I am still in the process of healing from a devastating car wreck in 2017 and I am still in active physiotherapy. Getting around has been very difficult and I have been missing entirely too many of my appointments and I now because of this new ailment I don't think I will be able to make it to any of my appointments.

I am so overwhelmed that I am just going to give up. Someone gave me the idea to try a GoFundMe and I thought that I really have nothing to lose.

Anything helps and I really appreciate you all!

"Most everyone is familiar with Zayneâs story, so this probably comes as no surprise. Itâs time for open heart surgery #3.

Background story if you need a refresher - Zayne was born with a congenital heart defect called ASVD. At 18 days old he had his first open heart surgery. With that, he had many complications including his right sided stroke. He was stuck in the hospital for the first 4 months of his life. Since, he has had many operations including a couple heart catheterizations and a coronary angioplasty with another lengthy hospital stay.

Tomorrow, November 1st, he goes for his third open heart operation, called the fontan operation. We HOPE this time around, he has a much easier recovery than last time. But, we donât know how long he will be in the hospital or how long the recovery may take. So here I am asking for your help. Brittany and Nate will have to take time off to be with him during this time and his recovery.

"Our dad, Terry Barnett, was diagnosed with N. A. S. H. (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) causing liver failure. He is one of the lucky ones to actually be called to get a liver transplant! We are raising funds for his post-operative care at Cleveland Clinic.

Once he is released from the hospital, He & Mom will need to stay near the hospital (within 50 miles) for 12 weeks of post operative care. They have to go in for constant check-ups and labs to be sure there is no rejection. We are raising the funds for these living expenses- short term lease apartment, utilities, food & fuel etc.

I have been asked several times so- 
There is NO free housing associated with the hospital for transplant patients. 
There IS housing for rent to patients, but there are short term lease apartments that are much more cost efficient 
Ronald McDonald houses are for families of patients 21 or younger. 
Insurance doesnât cover these expenses. 
I was surprised to learn these things as well, and itâs often one of the biggest obstacles for transplant patients.

Sadly he donât have insurance and is pending being approval for insurance and disability so in the mean time his prescriptions, DME equipment and other supplies is coming out of our pockets so we are reaching out for help something we never do but we really need help financially, and spiritually. He has no recollection of what happened and the other car involved wasnât given any kind of sobriety test and was sent on their way from the accident.",sadness
"On November 11th, Ruthie needed emergency surgery due to a ulcer that perforated her stomach. They gave her a 50/50 chance to survive surgery. This has been a difficult and exhausting 24 hours. The day after she is doing well and eating on her own. I was able to go visit her and everyone at veterinary speciality center of Seattle are doing an amazing job for her. However, this has left me with medical bills in the five digits and anything would help the burden of this live saving surgery. Ruthie should be coming home in a day or two because she is such a rockstar (her doctorâs words and my own). I hate asking for funding but if youâve had the chance to meet Ruthie you know she is worth it. Thank you.",anger
"I am starting a fundraiser for my 9 year old nephew, TJ Bell in hopes of helping his parents (Lisa Bell and Anthony Bodette) cover part of his medical bills for his bone marrow transplant procedure on January 30th, 2023.

Tj was diagnosed with Idiopathic Aplastic Anemia, an acquired bone marrow failure in June 2022. Heâs undergone numerous red blood cells/platelets transfusions and different types of bacterial and yeast infections while admitted at VCU Medical Center. Heâs also undergone pericardial effusion surgery in November 2022.

Tjâs bone marrow transplant procedure will also include an extensive chemotherapy and radiation.

Although there were times of discouragement and frequent frustration, Tj has never failed to be in his bright spirits. Heâs a brave boy. Sometimes I often wonder how a 9 year old child could be so strong. We can only hope that TJ will soon return to a normal life again and that his body will respond well to the transplant, as well as the therapy. Iâm not sure how long his body, most importantly his immune system will be able to withstand any future infections or complications.

Any help provide or prayers for my nephew will be truly appreciated. We are grateful for your support.

Thank you so much.",optimism
"Hi everyone!
On average, people with disabilities spend 20% more on living expenses than non-disabled people. I'm opening this fundraiser as a way for people to support me with current medical expenses and living expenses. As I age, my state health insurance coverage has changed, resulting in me having to pay out of pocket for medical specialists. If you're able to spare any change, it is greatly appreciated. I'm trying to develop new income for myself through my art practice and these donations will also help me with my art expenses. I have linked my shop and a way to contact me about possible commissions if you're interested in my art. Thank you so much for your support.

"On December 24th, Christmas Eve and her 30th birthday Christine was a passenger in a horrible motor vehicle accident. Her injuries are critical at this time and there are so many unknowns ahead for her and her family. We are hopeful she will turn a corner in the next few days.

Christine has worked hard in the last few months to purchase herself a new car and obtained a new job at a family owned business. Her ability to return to work is unknown at this time and we want to ensure she is able to keep her car and payments will need to be made while she is recovering. She will also need some things at home to make her more comfortable due to the extent of her injuries such as a new bed to support her injured back and other assistive and comfort devices.

At this time her family is traveling to and from Portland to be her side and also caring for her two young children who will need diapers and other necessities.

Any donations will be used to ensure her path to recovery is less stressful for her and her caregivers.

Please continue to pray for her recovery!

She also does have medical insurance but her medication and Dr copays now total In the thousands. At age 51 this has taken a toll on her and her family.

She is an avid gardener both flowers and vegetables. In the past she has always stocked her freezers with food for her family. Her husband just recently made many alterations to their home so she could use her walker, wheelchair, and motorized scooter to get around.

UPDATE: Julie was approved by Social Security Disability after waiting for over a year. Now she has to wait 2 years for any medical help. Let that soak in TWO YEARS FOR MEDICAL HELP. That stuns me!

"I have been diagnosed with Stage 3 Liver Fibrosis, caused by years undetected Hepatitis C. As a young grandmother of 4, mother of two, and wife of 42 years, I am frightened by the aspect of not having a fair chance to fight for my life. There is a treatment involving the administration of a drug called Harvoni. It is a very expensive medication, however, it has the ability to extend my life and put the virus into remission. 

The full cost for the course of treatment is $188,000 and after insurance, our out of pocket expenses are approximately $50,000. 

We have exhausted all financial avenues to cover the cost of treatment, yet still find we are significantly short. 

Unfortunately, I am unable to even begin treatment without advanced payment for the first full 3 months. This has created an overwhelming sense of urgency, necessitating my plea for help.

After a long road Brit and Kate finally gave birth to a bundle of joy named Willow.
With great sadness, three weeks after giving birth to this beautiful baby she contracted a rare bacterial meningitis as well as sepsis.

This has been a difficult week for the 3 of them. Willow just turned 4 weeks and has already gone through so much.
Currently in Windsor NICU, she has suffered strokes and seizures all while battling this awful infection.
Unfortunatly, Willow will need to remain there for a minimum of 6 more weeks. And continued therapy after being released.

My heart aches for them as I'm sure everyone's does. What will be their first holiday together has turned into a awful nightmare.

This fund is being started to help them get through these next few weeks, with many expenses with a hospital stay as well as covering bill expenses as Brit will be unable to work.

Anything that is left over will be donated to the Ronald McDonald House to help other families going through troubling times.

I want to thank you ahead of time for helping.

Luke will be in the ICU for at least the next month, but the nurses and doctors expect it will be many weeks, months, and maybe years before he will make a full recovery.

The family have now secured accommodation very near the hospital so they can remain by his side, and all stay together during this time.

For those who are looking for ways to support the family, and have the means to financially contribute something, a small donation will be of great help.

My best friend (weâve known each other since high-school) needs your help with medical bills.

Nikki has recently found out that she has a 5mm brain aneurysm in her internal right carotid artery in addition to a growth on her pituitary gland at the base of her brain.

"My name is Brenda and I am a single mom of 4. On 12/16/2022 a mass was discovered on my youngest daughter, Ellie (15 mo old). The doctor who saw her in the emergency room sent over her X-rays to an orthopedic and an oncologist and they all said the same thing that it was abnormal and worth looking into. Those doctors said it looks like Chondrosarcoma. This brought us to MD Anderson, where we met Ellie's new doctor and her team. They took some more X-rays and said it is abnormal and in the soft tissue but would like to get an MRI done to get more answers and then probably a biopsy.

This brings me to the reason of our GoFundMe request. I am currently in insurance limbo and have to pay for everything out of pocket until insurance kicks in. The MRI is about $6,800 and then the remainder would help with travel expenses for the MRI.

Brandon and BJ are super heroes and handling their brand new journey into parenthood like Champs! They are staying 1.5 hours away from their home to be by Miloâs side.

"My brother, John Hogg needs a full-sized van that can be modified for handicapped accessibility. He is on disability and has limited resources.
For almost 30 years, John enjoyed an active and enjoyable life. If you knew John before he fell from a deer stand in 1997 and suffered a T4 incomplete spinal cord injury, you would know how much fun he has had. As John has gotten older (60 years old on November 15th, 2022), mobility has been challenging. He currently owns a 1997 Toyota Camry, which has over 400,000 miles and getting in and out is almost impossible.
Our family has pitched in financially as much as we can, but a handicap-accessible van is a major cost. We would love it if his many friends, extended family and others could pitch in to raise $45,000 for a full-sized van. Vocational rehab will modify the van for his private use. We do not want him to be unable to live his active life to the fullest.",joy

"Please consider helping Addison and her family during her fight with Hurler Syndrome (MPS I).

Addison was recently diagnosed with the most severe form of Mucopolysarcharidosis type I (MPS I), called Hurler Syndrome. Hurler syndrome is a rare, genetic disease with no cure. Itâs caused by a mutation of the IDUA gene. Children with Hurler Syndrome are missing an important enzyme that breaks down sugar molecules in the body. Without this enzyme, the sugar molecules build up causing damage to bones and organs.

Although there is no cure for Hurler Syndrome, there are treatments. Addison is currently receiving Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), and preparing for Chemotherapy and a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT). Addison will be receiving her specialty care in UPMC Childrenâs Hospital.

Despite her challenges, Addison continues to be joyful and full of fun. She never fails to make her family and friends smile. Marissa and Chris are incredible parents who will be with Addison every step of the way.

Chris and Marissa will have to take an indefinite amount of time off of work. As we all know, medical bills can be overwhelming. It is our goal to alleviate their financial burden so they can be present with Addison throughout her fight. Anything is appreciated. If you cannot donate, please share to spread the word.

"Hi, my name is Tori. My daughter broke a tooth on Christmas. We took her to the dentist and discovered not only did she have a broken tooth but also needs 3 crowns. Unfortunately our insurance isnât wanting to cover all costs. The dentist wants $402 to even make the appointment then the remaining $1,324 2 weeks before the appointment. I never do things like this but I donât know what else to do or where else to turn. I hate that everything is about money.

"Hello all,

Recently a very close friend of mine was in a serious car accident. She was recently released from the hospital and is now home safe and sound. However, with medical bills and being gone from work, I wanted to see if people I know would want to participate in helping her family during this holiday season.

She is someone who always thinks of others' needs before her own and will probably kill me when she finds out that I set this thing up. This caring lady has been there for me and my family for the longest time and has basically helped raise my kids. I would be a terrible friend if I didn't do something to show support.

"Hi Friends and Family

Jess has faced the unfortunate reality of requiring heart surgery outside of Canada.

After 2 years of slow medical process and suffering 3 strokes, she was recently told that the cardiologist in Canada would not do the procedure. Every medical department wants to push responsibility onto the next.

The strokes are becoming more frequent and are causing both physical and mental harm. It has been a scary time.

And so, she has made the difficult decision to have the procedure done either in Mexico or Israel. We are currently interviewing doctors.

With that comes a great deal of out-of-pocket expenses.

This money will help cover - airline, accommodations, surgery, hospital stay, post-op care.

If you are able to contribute, any amount would be greatly appreciated.

Please feel free to share this with anyone you think may want to contribute. I am not connected with the vast network that she has built herself over the years.",fear
"On December 18th, our first grandson, baby Elijah (6 months old), fell off his parent's bed and was helivacced to a critical care hospital where he underwent a 4-hour surgery to remove the blood clotting in his brain. For the next week, we prayed as he suffered through seizures, MRIs, CT scans, EEGs, fever, intense stomach pain, and the unknown suffering he couldn't voice. The most difficult part of it all, especially for mommy and baby, was the lack of emotional response, the unrecognition and reaction to the people who loved him most. We wept over the extent of the injuries and what this might mean going forward. The future is still unknown, but last night Jesus woke him up and baby Elijah is playing and laughing with his mommy and daddy today!!! Praise God! We are rejoicing!!!

"Few escaped alive from Communist Poland through the Berlin Wall, into W. Germany and then to America. We met one of the brave few.

I am Rev. Norm Wretlind. My family met Arthur Simon the year he arrived in the US, 1985. We had just returned from visiting Poland to see my wife's only relative that was not assasinated by Hitler. Arthur was just 22 and worked for our neighbor who introduced us. He became part of our family for 5 years before moving to Seattle. We have kept in touch all these years.

In November I received the terrible news that Arthur was dying! He has multiple cancers in stage 4! He is 60 yr old and never married. All relatives are in Poland. I flew to Seattle to care for him.

There I found him living alone, barely able to crawl, sleeping on the floor, and in horrific pain. He deals with Insomnia, dangerous depression, lack of proper food and extreme pain 24/7.

Arthur is totally stressed out! A financial nightmare! Unable to work, he fears eviction for not paying rent. He can't pay medical bills or pay for in-home help.

My dad moved to ThIland to retire with his wife and son several years ago, life was good until covid hit..
As for everyone money got tight and he let his health insurance lapse. Thinking that nothing will happen... but it did unfortunately.
My dad is now on a ventilator helping him breath and his body is septic. He is on iv fluids and antibiotics. He needs to be in ICU but as he is not insured bills need to be paid as you go and its not cheap. I need to get him well enough to go home with his wife or well enough to get him back to Australia.

I am angry and upset that he let it lapse but we all do what we have to do when in crisis and he is my dad and I love him..

More than anything, we hope that any financial gifts will be a blessing and encouragement to them.",optimism
"Hello, we are Michele, Jason and Jonathan. Our mother, Joanne Laperle, was admitted last week to the ICU at Tampa General Hospital with a mass in her throat obstructing her airway. Because of where the mass is located, she could not be intubated but required an emergency tracheostomy and remains on a ventilator. Due to the holiday weekend and staffing shortages she is still awaiting biopsy, which will determine diagnosis and a plan forward. The three of us flew to Tampa from Vermont the day before Thanksgiving to be at her bedside and support her and her husband, Chummy, who recently celebrated his 80th birthday. We are sharing a hotel room and using Lyft to get to and from the hospital. Five days into this unexpected trip, we are coming to realize that our stay will be longer than we imagined. Medical services in real life do not move as quickly as E.R., Chicago Hope, and Greyâs Anatomy would have us think.

We have created a site on Caring Bridge where are providing updates as they become available. If you would like to help with expenses, we will be grateful for contributions made through this site, or free of charge to Jason, Michele, or me through Venmo or PayPal.

"Dear friends,

Mckellyn Kirby has lung cancer. He had always been an active, hard-working, family man. Anyone who know him, know how much he loves being with his family, traveling, cooking and playing cricket. But things changed last spring. After several weeks on anti-biotics to treat bronchitis like symptoms that didnât clear up, Kelly was then referred to a pulmonary specialist.  The specialist ordered more test.  That is when the nightmare started.  There were spots on his lungs.  A biopsy showed adenocarcinoma â Lung Cancer. Pet scan next confirmed Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  The diagnosis was as crushing as it was baffling to everyone, including the specialist and the oncologists.  A very healthy and active man who has never smoked now faces Stage IV lung cancer.  Unfortunately, thatâs the really scary thing about this type of cancer - about 40% of NSCLC are made late in the disease process â Stage IV.

Kelly started chemo therapy on July 15th, 2016, but it was not effective.  He was told targeted therapy was not an option. More tests were done. Kelly started immunotherapy but he had to stop because he was experiencing life threatening shortness of breath.  As Kelly waits on further treatment options his cancer progresses.  He can no longer wait.  He and his family are now seeking testing and treatment outside the traditional health care system.   Donations received will help him with the costs for more advance testing and treatment options outside of Ontario and Canada. ",fear
"Update! Zachâs treatment is in full swing and heâs starting dialysis. He recently had a surgery to get the port inserted into his abdomen and is being trained to do dialysis at home! Fun/good facts that we (Zach and all who love him) are thankful for:

- Zach has an entire care team dedicated to his well being. They are fab.
- Dialysis will make Zach feel better until he can get a kidney transplant. This will likely be the best Zach has felt in a year+. Yay!
- Eventually Zach will eventually qualify for some financial assistance, with some waiting periods and specific qualifiers.

Less fun facts that we have learned:
- Dialysis is quite literally a full time job.
- A major medical event like this is a smidge () expensive.
- The waiting period and specific qualifiers for financial assistance leave Zach in an awkward interim period, where medical bills are rolling in and heâs unable to work at full capacity (super sick from failing kidneys + abdominal surgery).

Zach could use a little help from his frands getting past this hump financially.

One of the good guys.
Recently, our beloved friend and Coach was diagnosed with stage 4 Colon Cancer. Everyone close to him, or who knows him, is in absolute shock and disbelief. Toby has spent most of his life Coaching others with their fitness, boxing and kickboxing. Being a person who always lives a healthy lifestyle makes things even more difficult to accept.
He's made a tremendous impact on the lives of many and now it's time to fight for our Coach.
With the Covid lockdown of fitness centres this past few months he's trying to make up for lost finances. Toby is still working as much as he can in construction (he's been doing this all his life too!). He is one of the hardest working men you will ever meet. But it's a difficult time. And with treatments coming up it's safe to assume he will have to slow down, or stop working altogether.
Being at stage 4 Toby needs the communityâs support immediately. In an effort to raise as much as possible there will be other fundraising initiatives so please lookout for other ways in which to help. We will update everyone here and through the Unified Training Centre social sites (the fitness facility where he Coaches).

He has done so much for others and now it's time to Fight for Coach Toby.

He was on life support from December 28, 2022 until January 9 2023. That said he is still far from back to himself. He remains in the ICU and may for some time.
Jason amd I spent most of the last year homeless we have finally been able to rent a hotel room to be inside for the winter but he being unable to work as day labour for God knows how long leaves us in an incredibly shaky situation. The $2600 I'd like to raise is only for the cost of our hotel room nothing else. This is the only option I see to keep us from ending up in the park in a tent again which at this point he would not survive. I have spoke to social services there is no more money beyond the $600 a month we get for rent that we can access. I'm sorry to ask anything of you.

Please give any amount you can to contribute to these needs as well as school supplies, clothing, Christmas gifts, and just to show him we love him so very much! Anything will help him and his grandparents, who have since adopted Logan.
Letâs celebrate this brave and beautiful little boy, who has been through more than you can ever imagine. Thank you everyone!",joy
"Hi! My name is Ryan. I was hit by a wreckless driver driving home from the bank after work May 26th 2022. My vehicle was totaled and I sustained injuries. Unfortunately the vehicle was leased for 3 years in 2021 with 16,000 down to get cheaper monthly payments. We lost all that money because the vehicle was totaled. They gave Nissan all the money and because it was leased. Nissan was not required to give us the difference between what it was worth and what it was worth. We lost 10,000 dollars because of this wreckless driver. Then the accident messed up my back and I can no longer work. I now need surgery and can barely afford to pay for it. I really need help. The constant pain is awful. My feet constantly tingle. If I do any activities. It gets worse and makes my foot feel like it's being impaled with a nail. Please help me. Even if it's just a dollar. This accident has caused such a hardship!",anger
"One of my oldest and dearest friends recently found out he has pancreatic cancer that has spread to his bile duct. We are waiting to find out if it has metastasized to other locations. If you knew Robert, you would love him. Heâs always positive, always joking. Heâs so funny, he should be famous, but heâs happy just making his friends laugh. He has always been an example of how to live life with great love and joy, even since his diagnosis. He needs chemo, then surgery, then another round of chemo. He doesnât have health insurance and the medical bills are going to be staggering. Please give whatever you can afford. Robert is one of the most faithful, kind-hearted people Iâve ever known. I would deeply appreciate any help you can give. Thank you! ",joy

"The Bakers are an amazing family who have selflessly opened their home to vulnerable children for the last few decades. So many of us have been abundantly blessed by their warm hospitality and generosity. Theyâve hosted countless birthday parties, BBQs, and are people we love just doing life with.
Now itâs our turn to give back, lend a helping hand and show them how loved and appreciated they are.
The Bakerâs 18 year old daughter Sarah has been really struggling with serious health issues and has endured chronic pain and several hospital trips for the last few years.
After countless doctor appointments, specialists, tests, and interventions, Sarah received a hard diagnosis that she has a rare blood disease that has no cure. (She also has several autoimmune diseases). In addition to this incredibly difficult news, theyâve learned that her only real hope for relief is an expensive (not covered by insurance) treatment that is given out of the country. This treatment will not only be a financial burden to acquire, but so will the travel costs, time off from work for Dad Errol and all that is required (hotels, meals, car rentals, etc..) when medical care is given abroad.
We would love for you to join us in participating financially with the healing of Sarah. Letâs encircle this family with the love of Jesus and our hopeful prayers as we all wait expectantly for God to use this treatment to bring real relief and even a miraculous healing.",love

"Hello, my daughter danielle has a rare condition called aicardi syndrome. She has been doing great and healthy until she got covid in September. She declined very quickly. After being intubated on a ventilator for weeks she got a trach and g tube put in. We have been at the hospital for 6 weeks and will be here for a couple more weeks to learn and train on her new life with a trach and a ventilator. I was working as a behavioral technician until all this happened. I have been living with danielle at the hospital trying to make the best of it but we have things we need to get.

"I want to try and do something for my husband, Brandon, this Christmas Season! This year we found out that he needed to have an almost full restoration of his teeth. This has involved root canals, crowns and building back up enamel. Years of clenching his teeth day and night plus chewing tobacco had caused a lot of damage. He has since quit the chew and Iâm so proud of him for that!

This summer he underwent phase 1 of the restoration which involved 3 root canals and crowns on 7 on his back teeth. Phase 2 will be to build up his front teeth, right now they are paper thin. Phase 2 could also involve more root canals.

Brandon works so hard to provide for our family and to make sure our son, Grayson, has everything he needs. Coming from law enforcement and now a heavy haul trucker, Brandon unfortunately, doesnât always get to see the best in people. I would love for him to see the softer side of people through this fundraiser. That he is loved and cared for by so many!

Phase 2 I believe will cost around $7500. Iâm hoping to raise $5000 for him to use to offset his out of pocket costs.

I love you all and Iâm SO thankful you are our tribe!

Merry Christmas!!!
Love,

"Hi, my name is J, and I'm raising money for my butthole. I know that sounds funny. It is funny. In this case, it's also true. I don't talk about it much, but I have a muscle disorder and have been in a motorized wheelchair for the past 16 years. That's a lot of sitting. I also have hemorrhoids. Imagine sitting on razor blades all day. That's been me for the last ten years. It's excruciating, and it has gotten much worse over the past two years.

This Friday, I will finally be getting surgery to get this fixed once and for all. The butt doctor will use lasers to chop off my hemorrhoids and fix my ass. I've already looked at the cost, and after insurance, it will cost me at least a grand.

This presents you a unique opportunity!

Imagine you are driving around town with your friend, and one of my songs comes on Spotify. If you donate, you can turn to your friend and say, I helped pay for this guy's laser butthole surgery. How cool is that? Imagine sitting with your tax person, and they ask you if you donated to any charities last year. Tell them you donated to rejuvenate my brown spider!

All jokes aside, money is tight, and I wouldn't ask if it wouldn't help me. Even if you can't donate, please share this because it's funny or because of the excellent lightning bird picture. Thanks.",joy

"Ella has always been an active, energized and happy child who loved gymnastics, jump rope, all star cheer, and being with friends. The summer of 2017 changed her life when she was diagnosed with severe Ulcerative Colitis. Since then, she has been hospitalized more times than I can keep count of and has received several blood transfusions to just stay healthy. In addition to her UC, she has developed other health issues including asthma, alopecia areata, diaphragmatic flutters, seizures and SIBO. Ella has had infusions of all the biologics that are available and has tried all medications to treat her disease. Unfortunately, her body now rejects all of them, leaving us with the only choice of surgery to remove her entire colon. She will be facing three major surgeries in the coming months and hopefully will have a chance to feel healthy again. We have struggled to keep up with all of her medical costs over the past five years and need help to raise funds for the additional cost of her medical needs and care. All of this has been overwhelming for us and any financial help is appreciated. Ellaâs entire team of doctors, nurses and hospitals have been amazing. We are so fortunate to know she is in good hands with amazing medical professionals. Ella is hopeful for a chance of living a very active and healthy life soon!

"I know Maureen would never ask for help, but I'm hoping we can all come together to make the next 6 weeks a little easier for them. Hannah will be in the hospital for another 6 weeks (almost 7 total). During this time, Maureen and Hailey are traveling back and forth to Portland to visit her. On top of the additional expenses, Maureen is having to take unpaid time off of work. Hannah does not like the hospital food and is understandably having a difficult time being stuck in the hospital. I am hoping we can raise enough money to help Hannah order food she can enjoy, purchase items to make her stay easier, and help Maureen and the family with traveling costs. Brooklyn will also be undergoing surgery next week, so they will have two children in the hospital. I know they will all greatly appreciate any help they receive. Thank you!",optimism
"I cherish my sister Julie. She is my best friend, and has a kind and loving heart.  And she LOVES children and makes a full-time career out of caring for, nurturing and teaching them.  She took care of my daughter Ella -- who adores her as well.

My whole family cherishes her too; she is our baby sister and now she has cancer.  The treatment plan is promising and the goal is eradication.  The hospital is an hour away in Boston; on April 12 she is going to be starting  five-day, six-week chemo-radiation treatments.  

The ideal plan is for Julie  (and one of her family members) to stay in Boston for the weeks of treatment, and if she is well enough to travel back home for the weekends.  This, and some other associated medical costs, is the purpose for the fundraising.  If a bunch of you guys who also love her give about $5 or$10 bucks each, we should be able to do this.",love
"Hi- my name is Beth and Iâm fundraising for a family very close to me. A very special teenage girl, Isabella Sauro, had a very scary situation 2 months ago. She was home alone cooking and her clothing caught on fire. Approximately 6% of her body has 2nd and 3rd degree burns. As you can imagine, this was a very dangerous and frightening event for her and her family. She has shown incredible strength through many procedures she has faced. She has had three surgeries including grafting and may need more surgeries. She will have permanent scarring from this. This has impacted her physically, mentally and emotionally. She is healing and has come a long way, but the road ahead is long and unknown. She has many weekly appointments for an extended period of time. The medical bills and costs of supplies she needs are adding up at an overwhelming rate. If you are able, please consider making a donation. Any help you can give is appreciated.

My name is Elizabeth Pacheco (Treantafel) and I created this GoFundMe to help raise funds for my father Paul Treantafelâs fight against cancer. A couple of months ago a large tumor was discovered in one of his lungs. He was diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Many people throughout Worcester, Ma and surrounding communities know him as Paul the Barber, working as a barber for more than 2 decades in the community, before moving on to work as a General Manager for a local GameStop. He has always enjoyed working in service to others, both as a barber and in retail. His family knows him as loving, caring, charismatic, funny, smart, fun, and selfless. Any funds raised would go towards paying for any medical treatments as well as assist in monthly expenses while he recovers from his pneumonectomy surgery and is out of work. We as a family appreciate anything you can give, be it a donation or a prayer for his well being. Any funds not needed by the recipient will be donated to cancer research.

Update: 
Dad is a little over 1 month post-op and is doing well. He is preparing to start step 2 of treatment, chemotherapy. He remains out of work still needs financial help for weekly expenses and treatments. Anything is appreciated, and thanks for your continued support and prayers. ",joy

I'm asking for help paying for Top Surgery

Insurance has denied it and deemed it cosmetic... it's not cosmetic to me

I hate doing this.. but I need help to pay for it

I have never done something like this before...

But I'm so tired of being unhappy with my body and after 6 years of hormones.. I have transitioned as far as I can without surgery..

So unless I can figure this out... I'm stuck in the wrong body that causes me to feel deformed for the foreseeable future

I don't like asking for help..

"Greetings, my name is Ed, aka Mr Chan. I am near deaf, and will be having surgery for Cochlear Implants on December 29, 2022 at Kaiser Permanente Sunnyside, Oregon . Performed by Dr John C. Goddard MD. As a friend told me, âNew Year, New Earâ
I lost my hearing on January 11th. It was frightening to say the least. As I went through numerous tests, and consultations, I realized I was grieving. I became depressed and scared.
Many know Ed, as loving to sing, play guitar and engage in presence with people by conversation, laughterâ¦ kinship. With the profound hearing loss, I can no longer hear music and be in a room with more than two people, as what you may hear as normal, to me is noise.
Despite the challenges, Iâm embracing my deafness and learning to see and listen differently. Iâve learned to bless my disability.
I have been fortunate to meet others with cochlear implants whom shared their experience and they are excited for me. Iâm praying and humbly asking for your financial assistance for my âNew Earâ Please consider a donation of any amount.
I hold all of you in prayer and affection.

 Sammy my Golden recently is having problems with his hips.  He walks really slow and heâs having problems getting up and down. I know heâs in pain. I need X-rays to know whatâs going on.

Millie will have to stay in the hospital until her due date, February 25th. She is weighing in at 3 pounds currently.

"As you may know I've been seeing cardiologists and vascular surgeons at home since last year. It took coming two hours away to find out I actually have an extremely weak heart that is full of blockages itself.

My heart is too weak to sustain the surgery required to fix my leg so I'm gonna end up without one.

I thought I was fine. But I'm going to have to buy a defibrillator vest, a prosthetic leg, a wheelchair, so many adjustments for the house...and being two hours from home for three weeks the hotel costs are racking up each weekend. It's all terribly overwhelming

"Just before the new year, our dear friend Helai was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. This was a shock - Helai is only 23 and always displays boundless energy, a positive attitude, and kindness toward everyone around her. She is one of the most driven young women I have ever encountered. Not only is she putting herself through school and working for our family as a beloved nanny, but she also substitute teaches at our preschool and helps care for many children in our community. She is working toward a degree in early childhood education and hopes to be a teacher after graduation.

After spending a week in the hospital over the holidays, Helai still faces a long road to recovery. She will undergo regular dialysis treatments until she is able to get a kidney transplant. We are hoping to raise money to help offset unexpected medical costs.",surprise

"Hey everyone!  As many of you know, my dad was in a really bad 4 wheeling accident on Saturday, October 8th. He was up north and had to get taken by ambulance to Cook Hospital and then air lifted to Duluth. He was in the hospital for 2 weeks. He broke almost all of his ribs on one side and one on the other side which punctured his lung. He ended up getting a massive blood clot in his lung and had to get surgery.  He also broke his spine in 2 places. He is back home and healing slowly. Health insurance was obviously a huge help but getting air lifted is not cheap.

I started my new job in August of this year but I fell and injured my back.
Unfortunately I have to have surgery so I can get full use of my left leg back, I have been using a cane and walker.
Since I have not been at my job long I do not have enough PTO to cover by first week off work and then my short term disability that starts the second week only gives me 60% of my wages.
I don't have savings to cover the medical bills since I used it to move home to Oregon in June, and I'm scared because I will not have money for food, bills, dog/cat food and February rent.
Katie is working as much as she can to pay her part but it's just not enough.
I hate asking but I really need the help.

"Hi, my name is Debbie, and I am raising funds for my precious one-and-a-half-year-old grandson, who has a rare form of brain cancer. He is the youngest son of Joel and Tatia. A few months ago, Russell began having difficulties walking and stopped eating. His parents took him to Loma Linda Hospital, where they discovered he had a large brain tumor. Russell survived seven hours of surgery but unfortunately had a minor stroke right after and lost function on the left side. Doctors say he will regain use of the left side with therapy. Now Russell is undergoing several chemotherapy sessions, followed by a stem cell transplant and radiation. The treatment is very aggressive and incorporates five different chemo drugs. As you can imagine, this is heartbreaking for the whole family. Joel and Tatia have three other sons. Neither parent works due to the demanding schedule for Russell's treatment and caring for their three other boys. They have fallen behind in mortgage payments plus the cost of gas for the hour-long drive one way to Loma Linda. Your contribution to this family is urgently needed and will give Joel and Tatia some stability for the family and allow them to focus on Russell's quality of life.

"On what was expected to be the best day of their lives baby Ralph Mason was born. While baby Ralphie is perfect in every way, Karina had a number of severe complications during and after child birth. Karina experienced severe hemorrhaging just prior to and during delivery leading to loss of clotting ability and the massive transfusion requirement of more than 20 units of blood, plasma and platelet concentrate. Fluid began to cause complications and the collapse of a lung and complications with her heart. Dialysis was attempted to remove the excess fluids before she was transferred to CRMC in Fresno. She is currently on ECMO, a form of life support. Sadly, this catastrophic chain of events lead her to become sedated even before meeting her baby and she is currently on a number of life support measures. The events have left her family, and extensive network of friends who would call themselves family as well, in a state of shock to say the least. While prayers and positive thoughts are needed and appreciated this will surely leave a financial burden as Ralph and baby Ralphie are left awaiting Karina to recover. The medical costs are untold at this point, Karina's ability to recover fully undetermined. We would like to ensure that the financial burden is not of concern for the family allowing them to focus on Karina and her return to her home and new family.",sadness

She is getting ready to face some trips for radiation, chemo and immunotherapy. These donations will offset her time away from work, medical expenses, gas money to get to and from her appointments or anything else her and her family might need. All of this is happening pretty quickly. She was reluctant at first for this fundraiser to be created. It is not easy for a strong woman who has never asked for anything, to accept such a gift, but with a little convincing, she has agreed. She has already had a mass removed from her brain. This took place on a Friday mid-afternoon. Monday morning, I was going to go visit and check up on her and I could not locate her. It should not have surprised me but not even 48 hours after surgery, she is walking to the car and headed home for recovery! This girl is a fighter!! I'm hoping these donations will give her a peace of mind and to be able to focus on healing. If you are unable to donate but want to do something, feel free to send up all the prayers you can.

As most of you know, my sister, Janice has been in the hospital for 8 weeks now. She experienced septic shock due to complications from surgery and has had over 15 subsequent surgeries over a span of this time frame.

As most of you know, we lost our Mother in March of this year and this took its toll on us and now my sister, my best friend, my confidant, the one person I couldnât live without is now in this situation. I hate to see her in so much pain and going through all of what she has endured since her hospitalization. Now we will be spending Thanksgiving in the hospital eating dinner there because she will not be home.

Needless to say with Janice being in the hospital for this amount of time, her medical bills are piling up while her son, Devon and husband, Scot are without her at home trying to get by with work and school and keeping up with everything else at home.

If you know Janice, she is always putting others first and helping out whenever and wherever possible. With this being said, Janice is not one to ask for help so I am asking instead. If you can help out Janice and her family out by donating to help her with her medical bills and treatment that she will need for some time, we would appreciate it very much.

"Brenda was an active young lady. Then one day while traveling on vacation she woke up with what she thought was a simple eye infection. After visiting the hospital and running a course of antibiotics the infection cleared but Brenda had lost some of her vision in that eye. Benda lived with decreasing eyesight in one eye for 17 years. Then one day the infection occurred once again. Brenda immediately sought medical attention. She found out that while on vacation many years ago she had contracted a parasite. This parasite is transmitted by birds. Brenda was diagnosed with Histoplasmosis. This causes her to have no central vision.
Brenda would benefit from the E-Sight Glasses by opening up her world of sight and allowing her to see things more clearly. Brenda is an active lady, who enjoys being outdoors. She loves attending Camp Dogwood each summer for the Blind and Visually Impaired. Here she can kayak and hike safely because it is a controlled environment. With E-Sight Brenda would be able to enjoy being outside once again in her neighborhood. Walking to church on Sunday mornings is a danger for her now: E-sight would help her safely walk to church.

While in the ER my blood pressure kept getting high and higher. Then it all of a sudden dropped after CT SCAN and ultrasound I had to have emergency surgery. I have to be off work for four to six weeks... I'm an independent contractor driver so any donations will help at the moment.. I will be very grateful and appreciative. I own my home and work very hard to keep my bills a flow I never bother anyone unless I really really need it and I really need the help at the moment. This was very unexpected and God knows I need the help thanks in advance to all who reaches out to help may God bless and keep you safe. Thanks again.",gratitude
"Hello, our names are John and Shirley Huyett, owners of a Wendyâs restaurant on N. Davis Road in Salinas, CA. We are coming to you today to ask for your donations for the memorial and funeral expenses for Manuel Anguiano, the general manager of our store for over 10 years; and, for the ongoing medical expenses for Guadalupe Alcantar, his wife and also a dedicated employee. Manuel and Guadalupe, were involved in a head on collision Saturday evening, March 5th on the way to a concert in Fresno, Ca. Sadly, Manuel passed away at the scene of the accident and Guadalupe was air-lifted to Community Regional Medical Center Hospital in Fresno with a broken back and numerous injuries. Our hearts are broken for the loss of Manuel, who was a hardworking, good father who loved his family and friends. We would like to ask for your help in donating to this cause for Guadalupe and her children. Their ages are 20, 19, 15, 8 and 7. Please help us bring financial relief for Guadalupe as she recovers from her many surgeries and injuries.

Hi my name is Bob. I met Nick last summer at a job interview. While interviewing him we just hit it off and had a lot of the same interests and fortunately for me Nick accepted the job offer. Heâs become a great asset to the company and also a friend. All of his coworkers really enjoy working with him and get along with him great. He would talk about his family and you could tell that they were very important to him. He told me about his daughter Hannah and all that she had been through. Sheâs 19 months old and a year ago had a liver transplant. Sheâs had medical treatments all along and has bills coming in from that and has a long road ahead of her yet. And Nick has to be away from work to be involved in that once in awhile. Then about a month ago Nick got sick and hasnât been able to work a lot. This past week he was in the hospital for a stay. Now since he hasnât been able to work the bills are coming in and money isnât there to pay them. They are going to possibly lose their house and car if they donât get some kind of help.,joy
"For those of you following along on our journey since March, you know that my Dad had 7 strokes and is on a long rehab journey. He has spent countless weeks at St Lukes and the Rehab Hospital of WI and is now home and working hard in outpatient rehab. If you're just joining us, you can catch up here!

As he continues to work towards independence, he has unfortunately exhausted his leave options with his employer of 30 years which has left us to spend our time and resources figuring out WHAT'S NEXT for him?!

His positive attitude and perservance is nothing short of inspirational, and he has been incredibly optimistic about what his new life will look like. As a family, we are working towards what the new normal is for him and so many people have reached out to ask how they can help.

Although his ability to earn a living has changed, I am so confident he has a lot left to teach us, and so many more laughs to give!

We created this link due to folks reaching out who are unable to attend the fundraiser we are planning. We hope if you are able, you'll join us on November 6th from 12-8pm at the Okauchee Lions Building for Jams for Joe ! We are so looking forward to having a building full of support and love!!

So much love to ALL who have prayed for our family this year.",optimism
"Hi my name is Emma. I have set up this page to raise money and awareness for World Prematurity Day. I am going to be donating the money I raise to Galway University Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and Mayo University Hospital Special Care Baby Unit.

Our son, Fionn, was born 10 weeks early in January 2021 weighing 3lbs 9oz. His first home was NICU where he spent 17 days. He was then transferred to SCBU where he spent 27 days. The staff were absolutely incredible in both hospitals.

I would love to contribute to both NICU and SCBU to show our appreciation for all that they did for us as a family and all that they do for others. I hope with the money raised they can make the lives of parents who go through similar that bit easier in what is a very scary time.

1 in 10 babies worldwide are born prematurely which is a crazy statistic and something I only found out after Fionn was born.

So I had the idea of raising the money to spur me on to do my first 10km since Fionn was born, a kilometre for every week of prematurity he was. Today I did the 10km run and am hoping you'll donate what you can to a worthy cause.",optimism
Rigby had some problems with his foot and needed emergency surgery to fix it. Still not sure what caused him to start licking it but his foot was pretty bad with infection and inflamed. With antibiotics and wound care it looks like it will almost be close to $700 including follow up. It doesn't look like cancer but he still needs help. Although I started a new job we are still catching up from when I lost my job in late October . Any amount will help. We love Rigby very much and I would hate to see my girls going though any hardship by losing him so I made the decision to go ahead with the surgery despite the finances. He's my homeboy and I love him so much â¤ï¸,love
"We are the Lutz family and are raising funds to help cover living and medical costs for our beloved son, father, and brother Kyal who has been suffering from kidney failure. Kyal is a hard-working, dedicated father who has built his life around raising his beautiful 9-year-old boy Clayton.

On Sunday evening of November 13th, after enduring a high fever and severe back pain, Kyal drove to the emergency room. A CT scan revealed his right kidney was failing due to a previously undetected congenital disability, causing high infection levels and a fever reaching 103. Our family was devastated to learn how much his body was enduring.

The kidney was infected due to complications preventing his renal system from draining, and on November 17th, he was hospitalized to manage his fever and high white blood cell levels.

Beyond the missed work and hospitalization costs in just this first week, Kyal will need help covering medical and living expenses as he recovers from his kidney removal surgery in January. We are asking our friends, family, and community to help us cover the high amount of these costs and provide Kyal some relief from financial stress so he can return healed to a vibrant, joyful life with his son and family.",sadness
"Hi all,
With my momâs permission, I am starting this Gofundme. The reason I picked this picture is because this is the Brian I know. He isnât doing well, and mom needs some help. She canât get him in and out of a car and a handicapped van is $6000! Brian also needs a special wheelchair, which is another $2500. Seeing the biggest goofball I know not be able to make the dorky jokes that make you roll your eyes, or do any of the things he has always wanted to do, kills me.

"Hi guys I really didn't want to do this - because embarrassing.
We need some help with funds for accommodation, medication, tolls, petrol and food.

So on the 17th of January Ryker had tipped boiling hot water all over himself.
We had immediately put him under a cold shower, after 40 minutes we had taken him up to the Crookwell hospital, they had also put him under a cold shower for a further 40 minutes. After dressing his wounds they had rung up Westmead Children's hospital where they were told to bring him up immediately.
When we got to Westmead, they were so happy that we had been able to keep him under the cold water for so long.
They have dressed the wounds with a special kind of dressing.
They have said that we need to come back to Sydney next Tuesday for a follow-up appointment and then maybe another one after that.

I hate that I have asked for some money, but please if you could possibly spare some, we would muchly appreciate it.

"Hi everyone! Thank you for making your way to this page. I have been best friends with Karla for 18 years now, and she is one of the sweetest, most loyal, funny, bad ass, caring woman out there. Sheâs an amazing Mom, Wife, friend, and doggo mom. As some of you may know, Karla was recently diagnosed with breast cancer, which came as a total and complete surprise. Karlaâs cancer is currently diagnosed at Stage 2. Sheâs having a double mastectomy, chemo, and then daily radiation.

In addition to all of this, cancer treatment will render her unable to work for a period of time. Last week Karla found out her company was merging and eliminating her position in June.

This GoFundMe would be for food, food for her 4 dogs, gas to go back and forth to Seattle for treatment, rent, bills and any supplies she may need for treatment. As Sean and Karla will have to miss work through her treatment, this will help to make both their lives a little easier through it all and not have to worry.

We cannot let expense be a barrier for Karla! It would be awesome if we could lessen her burden of medical expenses and missed work time so she can focus on the task at handâ¦. Beating cancer! Let's come together to help Karla kick cancerâs ass and have the future she deserves! â¤ï¸",surprise

Suddenly ill, and after a series of tests, the diagnosis was more shocking than any of us could have imagined, Stage Four Hodgkin's lymphoma.

With her mother by her side, she is bravely beginning her battle to fight this cancer.

Two weeks ago I received a message from my dad letting me know he was going in for some tests as his lymph nodes in his neck had swollen overnight. Long story short on September 1st, my dad was diagnosed with Lung Cancer. The cancer has spread into his lymph nodes. We have a long road ahead of us. His next step is visiting with an oncologist to run even more tests.

Even with insurance the cost will be more than we can bear. I hate that my dad and mom have to go through this, as this will not only take an emotional toll but also a financial one as well.

Any amount of donation will genuinely help my dad and mom through this journey fighting this nasty cancer. I don't want them to stress about finances as they have enough on their plate as it is. If you are unable to donate, please say a prayer and share. We love you all and thank you for your thoughts, prayers, wishes, and support.

"Hi, my name is Harry. On the 25th of February 2013, one of my best friends Nicholas Evans committed suicide. The year following that was extremely hard and the person I could count on to talk to and confide in was my best friend Ayden Lane. Ayden was very close to Nick and took his death extremely hard. Tragically a year after Nicks's death Ayden would also commit suicide on 2nd March 2014 to the shock of all his friends and family. I lost two of my best friends only a year apart and I couldn't understand why either of them didn't talk to me about the mental struggles they were going through. Mental health awareness for men has improved so much since their passing but there's still a long way to go. 75% of all suicides in Australia are men and boys.

To help raise more awareness and money for men's mental health and to do my part to keep getting the message out there that it's not weak for men to seek help and speak to someone, I will be running in the Ultra Trail Australia 50km ultra-marathon in the Blue Mountains on the 13th of May 2023. I will be donating the money raised to Beyond Blue a great mental health awareness charity. Any donation is welcome if you are able to help.

"This page is dedicated to raising funds to cover some of Chad's recent unexpected costs for his heart valve replacement surgery. For those of us lucky enough to know Chad and Amanda, we know this year has been difficult with Chad's health. As a cancer survivor, Chad has known that he would need a new heart valve replacement for several years due to radiation damage. The plan was to perform a routine heart test and then he was scheduled to go home and enjoy the holidays with his family. The test unexpectedly revealed severe valve damage and blockages in several arteries. He underwent open heart and valve replacement surgery the next day.

Having already gone through a new cancer diagnosis this year, this surgery will create additional unexpected costs. This fund is designed to give a way for those who want to contribute to do so. We see this as a way to provide Chad and Amanda with the ability to focus on his recovery and not finances during this time. If you are looking for a way to help this amazing family, please consider donating to this fund. Thank you!!",surprise

"Hey! I'm Brendon. You probably know me from the Charleston punk/alternative scene as the bassist from Super Runaway, Haunters, Dog Bite, Abrevity, and Hybrid Mutants (among others).

I'm undergoing surgery to remove a possibly malignant tumor and could really use assistance paying for the procedure, as I'm uninsured. We are not sure yet if it is cancer or not, but we have to be prepared for anything. I will also be out of work for anywhere from two to six weeks and won't be able to make rent for December and possibly January. I don't ask for help lightly, and I try to give it when I can. Until this procedure is done I'm unable to work or perform strenuous tasks, and it's incredibly frustrating not being able to do what I love for a living or simply play my guitar to create and pass the time.

Immediate proceeds will go strictly toward paying rent for December and medical bills following my surgery, as well as rent for January. Please know anything will help, no matter the amount. Any excess proceeds will be donated to Food Not Bombs, a collective combating hunger and food waste in North Charleston.

"As you all know my mom has had a rough go of it since having her 4th back surgery in September. She spent 9 days in the hospital and the doctor was amazed that she was able to walk before surgery due to the trauma in her back. After the surgery she was discharged and sent home after hurricane Ian shut down her hospital, only to get rushed back to the hospital 4 days later with an infection and spent 17 more days in the hospital. She was home for 10 days and the infection is back and now doing more damage. She needs another surgery to remove all signs of infection and to recut her incision. The bills are going to be massive and overwhelming for them. If you have the means to help it would be greatly appreciated but please do not put yourself in a bind doing so. I thank you for your time and will update periodically as we know how the surgery went.",gratitude

His kidneys have failed and is on dialysis. This was very unexpected for my friend and his family with him being so young ( early 30's).

Our beautiful, gifted friend and loved one, Jonathan Veals, is now struggling with significant health challenges. Let's be the support network he needs. As you can imagine, being in the hospital for weeks now with no actual end date in sight must be incredibly challenging--physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. I hope we can all rally together and support him financially during this time when he cannot work to alleviate the additional stress that having no income will bring.

Currently, Steven is being evaluated to get a second heart transplant and a possible kidney transplant. â¤ï¸â Can I just tell you that it is super scary. So mostly, can I ask you for all your prayers for Steven at this time.
I guess my friends know that we live in Fort Myers, Florida and Steven is currently in the hospital at Tampa General. It is a 2 hour drive which I am used to. I have been staying with Steven in his hospital room, but as things progress I know I will not be able to stay in his room and I will need to find lodging somewhere close to the hospital.
When Steven had his first heart transplant he was in the hospital for about 3 months. I remember the nurses attending him said his numbers always improve when he hears your voice. So, it is so important for me to be close. So many little costs arise from staying in Tampa. Could you help me so I can maintain my home in Fort Myers and stay with Steven in Tampa. I would be forever appreciative. I know itâs a lot to ask and itâs embarrassing too,

Mrs SÃ©golÃ¨ne and her family

A little over 4 weeks ago, just before Halloween, the family of Mrs. SÃ©golÃ¨ne, a teacher in the Preparatory class, received very sad news.

Ernest, Mrs. SÃ©golÃ¨ne's little boy, has been diagnosed with cancer. At 2 years old, Ernest has a very aggressive tumor that requires an intense treatment protocol (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, light therapy). The treatment will be done by cycle over a period of 1 year and a half.

Since October 29, Mrs. SÃ©golÃ¨ne and her husband have taken it in turns to take care of little Ernest, who has been hospitalized since that day. They must also continue to surround Augustine (who has just turned 5), Ernest's big sister, who also needs to be reassured and surrounded.

Since Mrs. SÃ©golÃ¨ne's place is now with her little boy, teaching on a daily basis is impossible. Her husband must therefore continue to work and ensure a presence at home for Augustine and at the hospital for Ernest.

Having no family in Canada, Ms. SÃ©golÃ¨ne and her husband will need a lot of support at all levels to get through this ordeal.

We are therefore appealing to your generosity to help them overcome the challenges that will arise over the next year...",sadness

I have what is called Chiari Malformation Type 1. In short, my brain is being shoved down into my spinal canal, which has caused me debilitating migraines for almost 30 years straight. I'm now experiencing numbness, tingling, and loss of grip in my left arm due to this, as well as the fact that my C3, C4, and C5 vertebrae are all out of alignment.

The only treatment for my condition is neurosurgery, or I could face permanent brain damage and permanent loss of use of my left arm. The surgery will put me out of work for a number of months, which we absolutely cannot survive. The amount listed in the fundraiser is my calculation of 2.5 months of pay; if more ends up being needed because my insurance won't cover something, I will adjust it. This will go towards our bills, cost of daily living, and all medical payments that my insurance will not cover.

Additional treatment may be required after the surgery but we pray that this will not be the case. Any amount donated will be greatly appreciated. Whether or not you can donate please keep her and the Drs in your prayers.",optimism
"My childâs nanny and I were pregnant at the same time. We were so excited that both of us would be welcoming babies into our families within months of one another. Unfortunately, her baby was born severely premature. She was only able to hold baby Jasper temporarily as he passed away in her arms, not even 2 days after he was born.

She had to go back to work because all the medical bills started coming in. Not only did she have a traumatic birth, culimating in an emergency C section, but she and her husband are also having to pay the NICU bills for a baby they no longer have here with them.

I cannot imagine going to work in the midst of such grief, knowing all my money earned would be going toward those medical bills. I cannot imagine losing a child.

I would like to be able to help alleviate some of the medical costs for them. If you are able to give in order to help, I know it will mean so much to them.",surprise
"Juanita Ivanochko is a wife and mother of three residing on a farm near Preeceville, Saskatchewan. She is well-known in the community for her kind and giving nature.

"Hello, as many of you may or may not know, just over a year ago I started to medically transition. As I hit my one year mark, I was approved through insurance and doctors to be eligible for top surgery. While we are lucky enough to have insurance that covers about 70% of the cost, there is still a pretty hefty out of pocket charge we would have to pay upfront in order for the surgery to take place. We have already had to reschedule once due to lack of funding, and hope that by the end of this April we will be able to meet our savings goal so I can get the surgery. Getting this would be eradicating my biggest insecurity, and really make me feel like my most true self. Anything helps, and we are more than thankful for you even reading this far or for sharing.",optimism

"Hello family and friends,

My name is Lisa Betz, and as some may know, I have been unexpectedly diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer over the past two weeks. It has been an unexpected process over the past couple months to narrow down my symptoms which have led me to this diagnosis 

Although life has thrown a curve ball, I believe God will help me through this tribulation. As Robin Roberts has stated, It's about focusing on the fight, not the fright.

Over the past couple of weeks, people have asked me how they can help, and I was unsure, so they suggested I create a GOfundMe account. If you feel led to contribute, it will be a blessing.

I would love for you all to walk with me through this journey by praying and if you want by helping me raise funds to help me fight this battle. Due to aggressive treatments I will have to be on an extended leave of absence from work. I am asking for support; my goal is to raise $15,000. Your contribution will help with medical bills, transportation, living and more. Thank you for any prayers, encouragement and support and may God bless you!",surprise
"To My Family & Friends,
I want to first personally thank you all for what you have previously done for me financially. I want to give you all an update on my journey. I am currently continuing to fight and declare victory over my life.
I am asking for your help once again due to the severity of the disease. I am traveling out of state to the cancer centers to receive treatments. The current treatments are not covered under my health insurance. All doctor appointments and medications prescribed are now out-of-pocket expenses.
Please help me by donating to this medical cause. I am eternally grateful to each of you for all the love and kindness that you are showing me. I thank you all in advance for your support and prayers.

I will keep on fighting and trusting in God.

Sincerely,

James F. Pinckney, Jr",gratitude
"My name is Patricia, I am 41 years old and I have 4 children aged 14, 16, 18 and 22. I have a very rare form of cancer. Since the diagnosis a year ago I have tried various therapies - unfortunately without success. Now I've come across a drug that gives me great hope. In the lab, this drug was 78% effective on my tumor cell samples!

The catch is that this drug is currently still in Phase 2 clinical trials in the US. Although it is already being used, the enormously high costs are not covered by health insurance companies due to the test phase. The medication can only be purchased on a cost basis and the therapy costs for one year amount to around â¬120,000.

Therefore, I am dependent on your help to finance the urgently needed medication. I'm not giving up because I'm a fighter and I love my life! I know there will come a day when this hard journey will pay off for me. Please accompany me on this way with your donation.

Your Patricia and family.",optimism

"Jason Carter âJJâ has been fighting a genetic disease, CASK syndrome, all his life.

JJ started running fever Friday. But he was stable. Christmas Day things took a turn. JJ started to become more congested and requiring more oxygen. Even with the oxygen, JJ was unable to keep his levels stable. He was taken to the emergency room at Detar Hospital where he tested positive for COVID 19 and pneumonia. JJ has respiratory issues daily so adding in any illness is scary. He was transferred to Texas Childrenâs Hospital in Houston and is now in the ICU receiving great care but remains unstable.

As you can imagine, Emily is there at his bedside in Houston and will not leave. Jason and the girls are home in Victoria. The travel expenses will add up. Haven, older sister, will continue to need her own daily medical care since she shares the same CASK gene and autism. This will create even more obstacles for the family.

No parent should have to worry about money at a time like this. Please consider donating to hep them with any expensive from having JJ at the hospital.

Most importantly, please pray. Pray for healing and strength for JJ and comfort for Emily, Jason and the girls. Pray for the staff treating JJ as well.",fear

"My name is Heather and I am raising money for Danny so he can stay close to his wife Bonnie in Vancouver. She was rushed over there in an emergency. Danny and Bonnie are two of the hardest working, warm hearted and friendliest people I know. We are always happy to see them walk into work. They always have stories to tell and bring smiles to everyone's faces. They are family to all of us at work.

Bonnie went into emergency and she was starting to have a hard time breathing. As they began to examine her, she had a small stroke. They proceeded with testing and blood work. The blood work came back saying she has a rare blood disorder called TTP, which is life threatening. It can only be treated at Vancouver General Hospital. The treatment is 3 hours of blood cleaning with plasma, like a dialysis machine, but bigger. She is being monitored about every 15 minutes. They are not sure yet what is causing the rare blood disorder yet. She will undergo further testing still. They are taking it day by day right now.

Please donate what you can so Danny can stay as long as is needed in Vancouver to be with Bonnie.

"Dear Friends,

We are raising money to help the Taylor family. Victoria Taylor is scheduled to have a kidney transplant on February 7th, 2023, thanks to the graciousness of a live donor. Victoria will be out of work for recovery for 6 -8 weeks.

In January 2021, Victoria was diagnosed with end-stage kidney failure. Victoria went into complete kidney failure the next month and has been on dialysis since then.

The money raised will help the family with the numerous medical bills and living expenses while Victoria recovers.

Victoria is the absolute soul of this family, and her courage through this difficult time has been inspiring.

Victoria's family and friends are incredibly grateful for all the love and support showed over this challenging time.

We will continue to give updates as we approach the surgery date.

Thank you so much,

Lorenzo Luca Roland Karkos entered this world 11-10-22 full of surprises. Lorenzo has a rare heart defect where he has a hole in between his atria as well as his ventricles along with a single atrial ventricular canal instead of two separate valves which would be his mitral and tricuspid valves. This causes his deoxygenated blood to mix with his oxygenated blood and lowers his blood o2 saturation. Heâs been through so much already starting off his life being put on forced air with 100% oxygen which heâs slowly been weaned off. His blood oxygen saturation sits at an average of 85% which for us should be 100% but due to his defect that is his normal. Heâs been in the NICU at the Ronald McDonald Childrenâs hospital which he was rushed to from St. Maryâs. If he remains stable he will be able to come home to allow him to get stronger so he can have surgery as his defect requires open heart surgery once he is strong enough. He also is strongly suspected of having trisomy-21 aka Down syndrome which is being confirmed with genetic testing. He has a loving family and an army of support behind him but we need all the help we can get. Any little bit helps. Thank you all for the love and support little Lorenzo has gotten already. ,surprise

"Itâs with sincere sadness that, after weeks of health decline, the sweetest, little 8-year-old was finally admitted to the hospital for continued fatigue, vomiting and other issues. Within a few hours Eliseâs parents learned that she had a tumor on her cerebellum that doctors had initially missed. She was rushed to a childrenâs hospital and has surgery scheduled today. The surgery could be up to 12 hours and recovery isnât fully known yet.

Although this will be a long and daunting journey for her four sisters and parents, they have been there with Elise from the moment she was admitted. The family has yet to find a spot at the Ronald McDonald house. They were told they should have a spot soon. As they are so many miles from home, commuting isnât an option.

In the weeks before Christmas Will, their two year old son, was diagnosed with (ALL) acute lymphatic leukaemia. It has been a devastating shock to everyone, and it left us all wondering how this could happen to such an amazing, bright and kind hearted boy . 

Following Wills diagnosis the family will have semi-relocating to Melbourne to be near the Monash childrenâs hospital and travelling back and forth for the next undetermined length of time the family will be required to base themselves within a close proximity to the hospital for Wills treatment and in case of any emergencies, they usually reside close to four hours from this kind of medical facility.
Traveling back and forth between home and the hospital is becoming increasingly taxing.

The next couple of years will be faced with continued treatment and therapies for Will while they work on getting him well again and returning to a normal childhood.

These men work 5-6 days a week, scuba diving for fresh fish, lobster, and Lambie or as we know it, Conch.

"This is Mars, which is short for Marley. Her favorite activities are coloring and taking baths. Show her anything red and she will fall in love with it. Mars' family and friends adore her sweet, kind, and innocent personality. Her favorite toys are unicorns because they are unique like her. She wins over the hearts of everyone she meets because of her friendly demeanor. Mars is the youngest of four siblings. She enjoys wresting with her brother and riding her bike with her sister. She enjoys spending quality time going out to eat with her family.
  Mars was unfortunately severely injured by a dog on 11/27. Her scalp was injured and she is currently in the intensive care unit at the hospital. Mars's parents are only allowed to visit her one at a time due to COVID restrictions. The hospital where Mars's is admitted is located 45 minutes to an hour from where they reside. As a result of her injuries, she will require months of surgery to repair her scalp, weekly doctor appointments, and therapy. 
  LeeAnna, Mars' mother, is a stay at home mom and Jerry, Mars' father is the sole financial provider for his family and he is currently laid off from work. They are in desperate need of financial assistance to help pay for Marsâ medical bills, rent, food, gas, electric, and other household expenses. Anything anyone could donate will be greatly appreciated by them.
  Thanks to everyone for their support in their time of need.

"Monday, my daddy had an accident in his shop. He was working building cabinets when half of his hand was cut off. He's had a successful custom cabinets business for over 41 years and has been a classical pianist for 65 years. Creating with his hands is in his blood.
His amazing employee was with him when it happened. He took my dad and the part of his hand straight to the hospital. Then they took him in a helicopter to another hospital where they have a hand specialist. He spent over 10 hours in surgery Monday night and they were able to successfully reattach everything!!
He has a very long road ahead with many more doctors visits, physical therapy and likely another surgery. My dad's career is with his hands. His business is small with just him and 1 employee. My parents will need help with the many bills that will come and paying for an additional employee during my dad's recovery. My dad is one of the toughest people I know but also one of the most caring. Thank you all so much for any help. I'll post updates regularly.

If you know my family personally and would rather send money directly, please contact me. Thank you!",gratitude
"For those of you who know my brother Mike know that he is an incredible, hardworking and selfless man. Mike needs all of us right now. Whether thatâs your donation, a prayer or even singing a song in honor of him. Mike was in a car accident, he has a fractured neck and spinal chord syndrome. Mike will need surgery, but in order for the surgery to take place his swelling has to go down first. Thankfully he has been able to walk and eat, and I thank god that his brain is okay. Mike is an absolute rockstar, and he is hanging in there like a champ!

This has been very scary for everyone who knows and loves Mike, and he will have a long road of healing ahead of him, but he is so strong and I know with the support of his community, family and friends, he is capable of anything.

Please, if you can, consider donating to help Mike with his current, and future medical bills and, if you canât, please pray to whoever you pray to or sing a song in honor of my brother. I know heâll love that!",fear

"Every one of us has been or knows someone that has been impacted by cancer. Cancer is a terrible disease that has taken so many lives. Around 16,000 kids are diagnosed with cancer each year in the U.S. alone. In fact, I was one of those kids; at the age of 12 I was diagnosed with stage 3 Rhabdomyosarcoma. It was a terrible event for me and my family. I manage to fight this disease and reach the milestone 5 years cancer free after treatment. As I managed to grow stronger and better I understood that no child has to go through this, and the main goal of this fundraiser is to send these kids who are battling this deadly disease a message that we care and pray for them and their wellbeing.

All of the proceeds from this fundraiser will be going to CS Mott's Children's Hospital.",fear

After two consultations with the Dentist, the best life term solution for me is permanent implants because of my age, health, and livelihood.

"In October of 2022, our friend and colleague Carol Swenson celebrated her 30th year of work in the healing arts, caring for others in West Seattle. A few weeks later, she received a surprising and scary cancer diagnosis; a stage 2 pancreatic tumor.

Carol is a vibrant 63-year-old who lives independently, enjoying the company of her cat and spending as much time as possible with her daughter Jessica, a local firefighter at West Seattleâs Station 32. Carol relied on her income as a massage therapist and home esthetician, but her diagnosis has prevented her from working. Her friends are asking for support from our community to help with mounting medical, integrative oncology and living expenses.

Carolâs doctors are confident that the tumor can be treated with chemo and surgery since it was found early, but she faces a challenging year ahead. Besides staying positive and enjoying each present moment, Carol told me she's already thinking about ways to help others through her cancer journeyâ¦ Thatâs the kind of person you would be helping with your gift.

Even the smallest donation would mean the world to Carol and her daughter this holiday season so they can focus on the fight ahead. Thank you for coming together as a community to help one of our own.",surprise
"On October 17, 2022, the Clayton family was rocked by the shocking news that their youngest child Griffin had been diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) at just 4 years old. A few short days later, it would be discovered he is one of the less than 5% of ALL who is Philadelphia positive, which means a more challenging road to recovery.

At this time, his parents, Nicole and Corrin, are focused on helping Griffin during his treatment and taking care of their older son Lucas. Corrin will be moving from working full-time outside the home to helping Griffin full-time.

Cancer is scary. The road to remission and recovery is long and expensive. With this fundraiser, we hope to reduce the stress on Nicole and Corrin at this time. They must meet their deductible and max out of pocket, only to turn around and do so again in a few short months at the new year, all while on a reduced income.

Please keep Griffin and his family in your thoughts and prayers. Know that if you reach out and there is no response, the thoughts and reach out are appreciated, Nicole and Corrin are just focusing on their kiddos right now.",fear

He was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), a disease that is usually diagnosed in younger children. His mother, Karen, immediately transported him to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and since that fateful October day, Ralph has been enduring a rigorous regime of chemotherapy that has left him unable to work or continue school. Even with all the chemo treatments, this month Ralph is scheduled to have a bone marrow transplant. A transplant that will cost one million dollars.

Karen is a single mother who has raised her children for the last 13 years on her own. To make matters worse, if that's at all possible, Karen has recently been diagnosed herself with breast cancer.

As most of you know, I've had some pretty big mystery medical issues going on for about 20 months or so now.

The staff there has always been so amazing. We made our plans and started preparing for delivery. We had everything scheduled and ready to go. But Lilly Belle had her own plans. Our sweet Lilly Belle born was born in the early morning on Christmas Eve. In the middle of a snow storm in Pikeville Kentucky. Six hours from the specialist she needed. Pikeville Medical Center took excellent care of our sweet girl, until she could safely be transported. She was flown to UVA on December 26, 2022. We dot have an anticipated date she will be released. We weâre initially told by her due date in late January. But as Lilly Belle likes to show us she doesnât like when we make plans. She has had some complications and her stay will be longer than expected. She is so strong and just keeps fighting. All the money donated will help with expenses for our travel back and forth.

"Solomon âSoloâ Gardner was airlifted from St. Peter Hospital to Harborview and is in the Pediatric ICU where he is being given very attentive and compassionate care. The event that brought him to this situation is not the focus at this time and rather the focus is on hope for what will be. He has had a traumatic brain injury. He is currently intubated meaning that he is not breathing independently but assisted mechanically. He has had some responsiveness neurologically which is a source of much hope. There are simply many unknowns as far as prognosis is concerned at this time. Several diagnostics have been done trying to piece together a story of what will be. Pneumonia has become a big hurdle along the way. Letâs hope for more grace, mercy and healing!

Many have asked how they might help in tangible ways. As the weeks roll by and there is anticipation that they could roll into months, support would be appreciated to help cover the cost of food, lodging, medical expenses, rehab, possibly home adaptations, and general bills as Holly and David spend day and night at Soloâs side.

Itâs taken me many years to get here and I know deep down this is what Iâve always wanted and needed. 

âLife-savingâ is an understatement. But the gender-affirming procedure of top surgery will do just that. 

I want this, and I need this, to be my last summer wearing a binder. 

Envisioning my life free of these boobs, I see a confident person, a more loving person, a more patient person. I see myself past age 40.

This financial challenge has been what has stopped me from really going forward with this and Iâm tired of waiting and tired of money being an excuse for me not deserving this. 

So, I need your help. Friends, family, strangers, if there is anything you can donate I would endlessly appreciate it. 

I love you and thank you all for taking the time to consider helping me.

He has been stressing about all this and we decided this will help enormously. I am thankful that he finally was able to walk. It brought me so much joy to walk with him in the hallways. He does it with pain but is very strong. Thank you all for the prayers and positive thoughts. The Lord has a very special plan for him and weâre lucky to have him here. â¤ï¸

"Hi, Iâm Brenda one of Debbieâs closest friends. 3 weeks ago we received some devastating news that Debbie had a brain tumor that needed to be removed immediately. A week ago we all learned that it is Glioblastoma which is an aggressive brain cancer. The next coming weeks are going to be very tough for Debbie because she will be starting Chemotherapy and Radiation. Due to all this she is unable to work which will add a financial burden and even more stress that nobody should have to deal with while dealing with something so life changing. Everyone that knows Debbie knows how caring, selfless and loving she is.

This go fund me has been set up to help alleviate the financial burden that Debbie will go through due to medical costs and living expenses due to being unable to work. This is the last thing we want Debbie to worry about while battling her cancer. Letâs help Debbie fight this!",sadness
"Hello, my name is Jason. I have been sick for a about 3 months now. I have been trying to work but would continue to get sent home because my blood pressure kept sky rocketing every day. It would cause me to get migraines and lose my eye sight. After they found out and fixed my problem my Wife had a stroke. This happened the very next day after I got better. They had to air flight her to Chapel Hill Hospital. Needless to say I didnât go back to work this week either. We have ran out of money. I have gotten some of our bills deferred but not all of them will do it. We are almost out of food. I have tried to get government assistance and have been told I make to much. Even though I basically havenât worked in awhile and donât make as much as last year due to hours being cut. Insurance doesnât cover all of my wifeâs treatments and help. Iâm afraid to not be able to get her the help she needs. Afraid of losing house and car. I have maxed the credit cards. If anyone could help please do. I put $7000 on the front but really donât know what this all will be. This is hard enough to ask for anyway.",fear
"As many of you may or may not know, Mel was diagnosed with stage 2A breast cancer on April 25, 2022. Since then, she has completed 9 rounds of chemo and has 7 more to go! Once chemo is finished and she receives the all-clear, she will need surgery with radiation to follow.

When Mel first shared her diagnosis with me, I was completely shocked, angry, and in disbelief. How could something so awful happen to someone so amazing?! Knowing the treatments, possibly losing her hair, being sick, and medical bills would be a lot for anyone, let alone My Mel. After talking with her, I wanted to help in any way possible.

"Hi, I'm Angela. I am fundraising for Watson Good Cat.

Watson has had a heck of a year. It started with being referred to a veterinary specialist for breathing issues. What we thought were allergies. After multiple visits to the specialist, a few x-rays, lungs filled with fluid, 35 days of medicine given 2-3 times a day, and a bronchoscopy, we now have a diagnosis of Chronic Bronchitis. He now uses an inhaler twice a day (the attached picture is of him and the apparatus he receives his inhaler puffs through). He will start prednisone soon. Hopefully, these medicines will be tapered eventually and only used with flare-ups. He will be getting more x-rays soon, as well.

Along with medicine and veterinary visits, other supplies like an air purifier, dust-free vacuum, and dust-free litter have been acquired for his ease of breathing.

Watson's unexpectedly expensive diagnosis and his mom's health scare that required a CT scan (Not to worry, I am fine) added up very quickly. If you have a dollar or two you wouldn't mind donating, Watson and I would be very grateful. The funds will help pay for his current outstanding vet bills.

Thank you!
Watson and Angela",optimism
"Tribe,
Each of you has walked beside me through the trials and tribulations of the last 3 years. In early 2019 I was living a dream. Then, life threw me a few curve balls to put it mildly. First, a stroke, then cancer, followed by the loss of my dream job. The totality of those events have placed me in a position I never could have imagined. I have exhausted my savings and am left with the unenviable choice of reaching out for some help. While I am finally feeling some traction in the search for a job, unfortunately it wonât be in time to support a proper holiday season. So,â¦with my head bowed and great humility, I am asking for any help you might see fit to give. In the event that Iâm lucky enough to get a job offer, I will return every donation.  I love every one of you and appreciate EVERYTHING you have done and continue to do. Love, Kevin",love

"Most of you know my brotherâs story. He was just 19 years old when he was diagnosed with liver disease, and at 23 years old he had a liver transplant. He has battled his health issues for over 20 yearsâ sometimes being hospitalized for rejection, but he has always come out on top. 
A few weeks ago he was hospitalized for a bowel blockage and after tons of tests and 18 days in the hospital (mostly alone due to COVID visitor restrictions) they diagnosed him with duodenal cancer. We are all in shock... he has been through so much in his 37 years of life and now this! 
He will be having surgery in the next couple weeks to hopefully remove this cancer and be able to move on with his life with his wife, Stephanie and little girl Ava. 
Obviously he is unable to work and his wife has been taking days off to help care for him. The medical bills are mounding up and I want to help ease their burden. If you are able to donate (even $5) please do. If you are unable to donateâ I understand that tooâ just stop and say a prayer for his upcoming surgery.  All prayers welcomed!!!! Thank you!

On October 25th she returned home with a colorful new pillbox full of meds to aid her recovery. Then on October 31st she was back in the hospital receiving four more stents after having a second heart attack. Recovery is not going to be easy. It will likely be lengthy including months of cardiac rehabilitation and follow-up visits with multiple physicians. She attended her first cardiac rehab appointment on Wednesday and walked for four minutes on the treadmill! This was the first of many steps on her journey to recovery.

This has all happened so suddenly and unexpectedly. I had to undergo heart ablation surgery to help stop the extra electrical pathways. Thank goodness I got the procedure done.

"I know I haven't posted update on Cameron in a while but he is still having daily seizures. Doctor in Orlando wanted to do brain surgery, corpus callosotomy, but we refused. He did help Cameron get off 3 seizure meds so I am thankful for that. After that Dr we tried a natural one specializing in CBD and MMJ. Unfortunately CBD didn't help and the doctor isn't very involved so hard to do things without him.
Last month I got an unexpected phone call from Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota. I had actually reached out to them before the Orlando doctor but never heard back. They reviewed and accepted Cameron's case and we have a week long stay in January.

"Emily and her adorable 6-year-old son, Theo, are Port Townsend locals whom you may have seen palling around town. They are an inseparable duo who have always made the best out of challenging circumstances. 

Last week, Theo came down with what seemed like a normal cold, as most kids do this time of year, but things took a turn for the worse. After multiple ER visits, and Emily insisting that she knew something more serious was affecting her son, they finally transferred him to Tacoma Childrens Hospital. There they learned that Theoâs immune system, instead of fighting off whatever virus or infection he had, had started attacking his brain, causing fluid build up and swelling. 

Theo has now been at the Childrens Hospital for about a week as they continue to try to bring down the swelling with a heavy dose of steroids. Heâs still unable to walk normally or communicate clearly. Emily is scared and tired but has not left his side.

Emily is a single mom who works full-time to support herself and her son. Sheâs resilient and an amazing mother, but there are still a lot of unknowns about what the future holds as Theo continues to fight and heal. The funds raised will help take some of the financial stress off of them as they navigate the coming weeks. Any amount, big or small, is appreciated.",fear
"Jenny was diagnosed with an aggressive and rare form of cancer in June 2022. The biopsy revealed a type of internal melanoma that occurs in only 1% of all melanomas--called Mucosal Melanoma. Jennyâs surgeon explained this type of cancer has a 5-year survival rate of only 25% with aggressive treatment. Unfortunately, due to its rareness, not many treatment protocols are known. Jenny had an initial immunotherapy infusion, which immediately resulted in several negative side effects landing her in the hospital. After her release, her oncologist suggested more of the same with close monitoring. Two different surgeons declined the removal of the mass due to its certainty of metastasizing. Thus began her search for integrative options, which she is also pursuing.
As overwhelming as this appears, Jenny remains positive and hopeful. Her faith in God is just something! It has not wavered! âALL things ( yes, even cancer) work together for good, for those who love God and are called according to His purpose.â (Romans 8:28). May her faith in Jesus be a witness to us all.
By creating this GoFundMe site, we hope that Jenny and her 7-year-old daughter, Jovi, will not have to suffer from a financial standpoint. She is currently working only part-time. If you can contribute financially and/or in prayer, know how grateful she is for everyoneâs care and support. We do not know the outcome of her journey, BUT we know the ONE who does.

I was diagnosed type 1 diabetic when I was just 17, and a lifetime of trying to manage my sugars has weakened my kidneys which led to kidney failure.
