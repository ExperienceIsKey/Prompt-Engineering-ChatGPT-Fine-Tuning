"Well, another seizure decided to sneak up on me and hit me with its best shot! Again, I do not have any recollection of this incident. I was told that I was blue when they found me, gray and arm was cold as I lay on the gurney! I had to be resuscitated twice and a 3rd time in the ICU! My brain had swelling so I had to be iced up like a keg cooler! They didn't know if I was going to come out of it, and if I did, what kind of condition would I be in? Brain dead? Vegetable? Could understand but mobility all screwed up? I scared the hell put of my poor family who drove in from everywhere to be by my side until I got through this! They are absolutely amazing and I have to give a HUGE shout out to the fucking rock of our family, the most selfish, positive, unbelievably head strong woman to walk this 3rd rock.... MOM! You never get enough thanks! We'd all be lost without you and that's no joke!"
"The reason for this GoFundMe is to help me live a normal life after I had my left leg amputated from diabetes. Currently, I cannot access my home on the second story due to all of the stairs, so I moved in with my Son and his family. Insurance does not cover a stairlift so I am asking for your help.

About myself: I am a 67 year old diabetic who struggles with many normal life activities. I dropped out of school in 8th grade, moved out at age 14, met my wife at 18 & started a family shortly after. Now, I am a retired bus driver but nothing will stop me from getting up and moving. I love to work and can fix pretty much, anything. I love telling jokes to make people laugh & prior to my leg amputation, I would donate my time to Woburn pop Warner football, where my grandkids played. My wife and I have 6 kids and 13 grandchildren. My favorite past time is camping and I have a trailer parked in Salisbury that I hope to get back to one day. 


Funds raised will help me purchase a stairlift so I can get back home.
I cannot express the gratitude I feel just knowing that people care. Every $1 counts so donât feel bad or embarrassed if thatâs all you can donate, I appreciate everything & everyone. "
"Hi, my name is Debbi and Iâm fundraising for my brother Donald Webb. The sad news is that he is only 51 years old, and in 2016 he suffered a series of strokes that resulted in loss of motor skills and memory loss. Recently he was sent to the hospital because his kidneys are failing and is heading toward dialysis. This is in addition to other failing health factors including high blood pressure and diabetes. He needs to stay in the hospital for an extend amount of time. Each day he is in the hospital costs $450 to hold his bed at The Regency at Shelby in Shelby Township Mi, his care facility. Any help given would make sure he is cared for."
"Unexpectedly on Friday my blood pressure skyrocketed. Causing me to have to go to the er. Once there, I was transferred to Dallas and diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. I am told I will be here until Greyson is born, which could be now to 34 weeks. Not only will he be premature , he has a heart defect that will most likely require surgery to correct. This was entirely unexpected. We have 3 other kiddos at home who still have needs and bills to be paid on top of the expenses that come with being in the hospital. Joseph has to eat and go back and forth between Dallas and Tyler. Any help is greatly appreciated as we navigate through these new challenges."
"My wife Janice was recently diagnosed with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia and will need to stay in the hospital for an extended period of time, for at least a month. While we are grateful that the outlook for her cure is positive at the moment, we will run into some financial shortages during this difficult time (e.g. ambulance and hospital expenses, mortgage, child care for our two daughters, other family expenses, etc.). Hopefully with this GoFundMe campaign, we would be able to raise some money to support our financial needs during this time. We are hopeful that Yeshua has His plan for us. We strongly believe that the most powerful treatment is praying to Yeshua."
"hi everyone, iâm writing to raise awareness and funds to cremate my dad. My dad is currently on his death bed, he has a few days left. itâs only my mom thatâs working to take care of me and my 2 younger siblings, so we donât have enough money to give my dad a proper resting place.

thank you all so much, if u canât donate just please share. thank you

update: hello everyone, my dad has passed away on 10/29, thank you for all the support and love. Weâve raised so much so far and iâm really grateful for every single dollar. thank you. we are now raising money to pay for his cremation and other funds for him. i was thinking of buying jewelry with his ashes inside so we can always have him around. with this money we can make that possible because of all your help. thank you so much."
"Hi there. I hate that I'm even considering this, but at this point I probably have no pride anymore (sadly) so why not. Even if only $5 is raised that's $5 more towards these bills than I had! As most of you know, I've had some pretty big mystery medical issues going on for about 20 months or so now. With that has come all sorts of tests, procedures, medications, etc. While I have pretty decent health insurance, the bills for what I owe after insurance are starting to roll in more & more. I truly hate to beg for help, but honestly, I figured at this point what's it going to hurt if I do. Y'all have already formed your opinions of me, positive or negative, so why not?!"
"Hi my name is Caio (Luiz Silveira), I've been a Flickr digital artist since 2010, with over 2.7M views of my works.

I am 75 years old and I have an American stepson who helps me a lot. Health at this age brings many surprises - I have to do a surgery at a private hospital next month which will be very expensive and my son and I are saving money but our finances are limited.

So we decided to create a fundraising (GoFundMe) for help and we are asking for help from our friends and family. If you can help with something I will send you some printed A3 works by mail - of your choice.

I really enjoy expressing and sharing my art with all of you in the Flickr community.

Anything you care to share will be greatly appreciated.

Caio (Luiz Silveria).
